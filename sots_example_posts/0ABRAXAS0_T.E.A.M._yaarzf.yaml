  body: 'As /u/theteamerchant says, the TEAM is on pause while more technology is
    developed. Basically, the protocols were too effective and the conversation quickly
    evolved beyond what could be represented. Free software that allows people to
    build shared taxonomical structures and that combines the chatroom with a library
    curation interface is needed. Unless we have adequate software, the TEAM doesn''t
    work at scale, it just creates groups that grow and then go to seed once they
    reach a certain size. Without tech to network these dividing and dispersing groups
    together somehow, it isn''t really a coherent project. The terminology and theory
    is there but the productiveness of actual communication practices outflanks it.


    The tech has been evolving and is almost there. If anyone is a good developer
    who might be willing to help, PM me.'

      body: The bottleneck right now is on developing consensus on which frameworks
        and digital protocols to use, so if you know about web frameworks or can help
        with researching and evaluating in that area, you might be able to help a
        lot without it taking much time.

      body: I have full free time now and no developing experience. If only there
        were a way of combining your knowledge with my general learning skill and
        free time... but I hate learning technical programming. I prefer to write
        my own codes poetically. If this can be of use in any way, I donate it for
        anyone.

I used to frequent here years ago and I'm wondering if anything has come out of the TEAM yet?  It seemed very promising circa 2017, did anything productive come out of it?

Seemed like a great idea, if it's still around how do I join?

Thanks.
