    no, it is not SOTS-related but just describes sci-fi battles.'

    body: Never said it was manga. And I think it thematically fits in with this sub,
      but you do you (complain on the internet about something that's free). Also
      you can just fill in the fields with gibberish, but you're smart so you know
      that already :)
