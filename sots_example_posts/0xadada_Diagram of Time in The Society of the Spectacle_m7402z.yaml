  body: 'I''m working on a new translation of The Society of the Spectacle, and developed
    this diagram of Debords'' conception of time. I''m including it as a figure for
    thesis #150.


    Debord only calls out a few hard dates, Year I of the Roman Republic, the adoption
    of the Gregorian calendar in 1582, and the French wars of the republic.'

      body: "This book isn\u2019t as much a straight translation as an elaboration\
        \ that attempts to bring more to the text than existed in the original French.\
        \ This is an attempt to contextualize abstract ideas, bring in references\
        \ and annotations in order to add additional color, and I\u2019ve added a\
        \ few thoughts and examples to help elucidate difficult concepts. Debord himself\
        \ says this is necessary in thesis 207:\n\n> Ideas improve. The meaning of\
        \ words, freshly imbued with d\xE9toured semantics, participate in the development\
        \ of these ideas. Plagiarism is necessary, progress demands ideas embracing\
        \ the author\u2019s phrasing, exploiting their expressions, erasing an official\
        \ lie and replacing it with correct ones.\n\nThis book is my attempt to participate\
        \ in the development of these ideas, at least I\u2019ve tried to ground some\
        \ of his more abstract ideas upon the terrain of contemporary surveillance\
        \ capitalism. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a translation that aims to stay\
        \ faithful to Debords\u2019 classical French prose, there are editions perfectly\
        \ suited for that purpose, I would direct you to the translations by Ken Knabb,\
        \ Donald Nichonson-Smith, or Fredy Perlman \u2014all of which I used extensively\
        \ during the preparation of this book.\n\nMy hope is to make his ideas more\
        \ accessible than the other existing ones, and to show how much more relevant\
        \ they are today then when first written."

    body: "\nDebord was pre-postmodernism, but discussed the idea with a few different\
      \ terms, but most broadly with his concept of pseudo-cyclical time. From my\
      \ books glossary:\n\n>  **pseudo-cyclical time (temps pseudo-cyclique)**\n>\
      \ Also called \u201Cconsumable time\u201D and \u201Cfree time\u201D, this is\
      \ time created outside the time spent working (see time of production), largely\
      \ weekends, holidays, vacations, and festivals. It is the same as the time of\
      \ production in that it is a homogeneous, fungible, and equally segmented unit\
      \ of time. This time is subservient to time of production in that it is created\
      \ as a by-product of labor, given as a gift to the workers from the owners of\
      \ the time of production. It is valued more highly by the workers because of\
      \ the ability to consume this time freely.\n\nI'd say, you should read thesis\
      \ no\xBA 219 [direct link to footnote](https://unredacted-word.pub/spectacle/#fn219.1)\
      \ as Debord discusses this idea most concretely:\n\n> The spectacle obliterates\
      \ the boundary between self and world by crushing the self beneath a constant\
      \ siege that saturates perceptions of lived experience with the continual presence\
      \ / absence of the world. The spectacle obliterates the distinctions of true\
      \ and false by burying the true lived experiences of reality beneath the real\
      \ presence of falsehood maintained by the predominance of spectacular media.\n\
      \nIn my footnote (see link above), i directly cite Rushkoff, who named it, like\
      \ you said, _presentism_, which Debord describes by citing Hegel thus: \u201C\
      continual presence / absence of the world\u201D Douglas Rushkoff refers to this\
      \ concept as it manifests in technology as presentism, an obsession with the\
      \ now at the expense of the future and the past, a continual present. In the\
      \ face of this obsession, we \u201Cend up reacting to the ever-present assault\
      \ of simultaneous impulses and commands.\u201D\n\nMore recently, Jenny Odell\
      \ aptly described our contemporary state of reactionary social media as it saturates\
      \ our experience thus: \u201Csocial media so often feels like firecrackers setting\
      \ off other firecrackers in a very small room that soon gets filled with smoke.\u201D\
      \ See Odell, J., _How to do Nothing_."

      body: Excellent reply, thanks. I hadn't heard of Odell or Rushkoff before so
        I'm glad to get some new reading material. I'll have to try giving *Spectacle*
        another shot.
