      body: they can commodify the means by which one *might* experience those things,
        but there is never a guaranteed enjoyment of those things, which is what's
        advertised. merely the opportunity. hence why so many people are actually
        always miserable on vacation, etc.

          But the same argument can be made for everything related with emotions.
          They can sell food, movies, stand-up, clothes but they can''t comodify the
          way someone will experience it. Except drugs. Drugs can do happy.


          Except from the forest example. There are places tha require a fee to visit
          certain mountains and forests.'

          body: Get a really thick silicone based if you don't have any toys or if
            you have toys there's an equally thick water-based that you have to apply
            more often but you can get them both with a little bit of lidocaine so
            that your sensitivity is slightly reduced and you can last a little bit
            longer and have more fun because you're already having fun why don't have
            more and if you're really adventurous and you haven't been wounded in
            the knee like me, a bottle of jlube powder last Christ you can make gallons
            of that shit but I mean that's like getting into well you do you I bought
            a bottle I didn't realize how strong it was and how little you need to
            you know and it just made a mess but I think one bottle can make like
            you know enough to fill at least a 50 gallon barrel how much more do you
            need as much as you want I guess because you're awesome My wife and previous
            lovers they loved absolutely enjoyed introducing lubrication it's the
            bedroom Young people have been convinced that lubrication is for older

  body: Anything that requires no alienated human labour - a commodity must embody
    value in order to be a commodity. That is not to say that things such as love,
    meaningful social connections, etc are not routinely subverted into toxic mimics,
    then commodified and marketed by Capital. They are.

  body: While there's plenty of money lining up on the other side of this bet, I have
    a hunch that psychedelics are going to prove to be the poison pill that eats the
    host from the inside out, and that efforts to market a panacea to chase away all
    those niggling reservations and unspeakable intuitions and restore workers to
    maximal productivity, will instead undermine the willingness of individuals to
    participate in and perpetuate the logic of exploitation without which the system
    cannot function. Maybe that was Peter Thiel's secret plan all along, and the Randian
    supervillain shtick was just what it took to get in the right rooms and shake
    the right hands.
