  body: 'Couldn''t agree more with your sentiments on the death throes of the system.


    Society of the Spectacle is a great book and brought to the forefront a reappraisal
    of alienation and commodity fetishism as filtered through electronic media but
    it has it''s limitations. The situationists were in many way truly badass philosophers
    but they also fully believed for the most part in a Marxist revolution and Marxism
    as a primary means of solving societies problems. They were responsible for may
    1968 in France and influenced many first rate European thinkers such as Deleuze
    and Baudrillard among many but ultimately there are dated artifacts and concepts
    in that book just like any book that is 40+ years old. He wrote a book in the
    90s called "commentary on society of the spectacle" and it opens with the line
    something like "I know the 50 or so people who anticipated this book will be excited..."


    However if you look into the esoteric meanderings of the surrealists (history
    of surrealism and secret societies is a cool summary) you''ll find that their
    views of reality "sur"-reality- were quite a bit more complex and did not fit
    neatly in any philosophical box and that was ok with them and IMO that kind of
    wiley intangible, sublime quality to a thought process, poesis, poetry, art, whatever
    you want to call it, is the mark of a *superior* system not an inferior one. Hopefully
    you will find more of what interest the tip of your tongue here as you click back
    and dig around past threads. Glad you found it! Enjoy!


    [heres an article I just found tonight](http://realitysandwich.com/118054/synchronicity_myth_and_new_world_order/)
    that you might enjoy and goes along with your death throes-not-nwo idea quite
    well.'

          body: "Bauhaus, dada and surrealism all remind me a lot of that adventure\
            \ time episode called food chain. \n\nAt the beginning all the little\
            \ figures are archetypal basics - circles, squRe and triangle- kind of\
            \ like Egyptian or Pythagorean primals incarnating into the world to have\
            \ the spiritual experience of ever increasing complexity and entanglement\
            \ with matter. But you constantly see this return to basic geometrical\
            \ and basic conceptual even color schemes in that cartoon.\n\nAnd that's\
            \ kind of what those art movements and philosophical movements were to\
            \ me. Especially surrealism as a cultural and philosophical movement.\
            \ But the general idea just like with dada being anti-art yet an art movement\
            \ all three of those are very similar because they were attempting to\
            \ use language to destroy language, art to destroy art, symbol to destroy\
            \ symbol in a way etc they were very much concerned with the death and\
            \ destruction of World War I and they were coming to realize the horrific\
            \ power of language, narrative, myth and ideology so they were venturing\
            \ back into the same Labrinthian halls that would beget structuralism\
            \ - studies of animism, totemism, primitive art, primitive masks and dance\
            \ etc. An attempt to get down to the rudimentary forms of human expression\
            \ but we might say the essential forms of human expression as in essence\
            \ timelessness idealism etc.\n\nThe cultural ideas of dada especially\
            \ political ideas brought to light\u2026 I think gave birth to what would\
            \ become propaganda although we can hardly say that dada was an explicitly\
            \ propagandic movement,  rather propaganda happened to dada. "

I was pretty blown away! So many of these topics have been on the tip of my tongue, yet I had no formal words to describe it until now. For example, the commodity of time, the death of art, and the death of ideology. 

I have long wondered where art has gone. Why is it absent in our modern life? I have long wondered why there seem to be no competing ideologies to capitalism. Greece seems like she would be ripe for a transformation with a new ideology, yet none have been presented. This essay (?) really explains it all in the form of the Spectacle. 

I did have a couple thoughts, though, where I think he missed the mark or didn't quite get there. 1) He mentions "working councils" as a possible solution. I think this is contradictory to his chapter on Time. I also imagine that working councils would be just as susceptible to corruption as our current management structure and in the working council structure, we are still working for capital, no? 2) There is a chapter where he discusses the contradiction that the Spectacle faces regarding eliminating jobs in the face of technology and also creating jobs in order to keep the commodity of labor status quo.
