  body: 'I think your last point is a lot less humorous than you initially perceive
    it.


    If you look at the Queer History you can see that it''s *always* had radical anti-establishment,
    anti-corporate focus. Specifically to distance itself from assimilation into mainstream
    Hetero-Culture. The fruition of marriage is a Spectacle all in itself -- It is
    representative of the co-option and commodification of Queer social sphere. We
    even have gay ''Stars'' living out the spectacle of exception gayness (you know,
    white, affluent, nuclear family assimilationist, academically educated, etc..)
    from media such as Modern Family, and Ellen Degeneres.


    The Queer revolution wanted something that would cost a lot to the existing social,
    economic, and political climate; thus it was sensationalized and plastered everywhere
    that gays wanted a sexy and marketable thing like marriage instead of something
    real like HIV/AIDS prevention.


    edit: I guess my point is, is that gay marriage specifically is the fruition of
    Spectacle generation and co-option. '

I thought I’d compile a list of signs that point to capitalism’s intense struggle to maintain itself in present form, as it has likely already reached its peak growth rate through globalization:


* Trade Treaties like the TPP (underneath the facade, this is simply a "legal" transfer of wealth from the taxpayers to corporations during arbitration (no judge and no jury, just lawyers in secret) and could cost nations billions in “expected, but lost future profits”)

* The new corporate trend in technology to split the company up in order to sell off large chunks of product lines (infinite profit isn’t sustainable and we’re seeing that come to fruition as boards are frustrated with companies that can’t keep up that pace any longer)

* Relentless outsourcing to impoverished nations.

* European nations decoupling from the Euro or considering it.

* Corporate buy-ups of wind farms and waterways/watersheds, as oil is a finite resource.

* Endless wars under the guise of terror for the last scraps of oil and natural gas in the Middle East and Africa.

* The US’ proxy wars with Russia in Ukraine and Syria over their strategic pipeline locations.

* Intense “need-based” advertising for unnecessary products like the Google watch.

* The ever increasing belligerence toward the individual contributor at corporate annual review cycles. (ex: “The Bucket System” which acts as a grading bell curve - someone will always not get a raise or worse, fired.)

* The media’s 24/7 news cycle of repetitive, useless stories - the recent prison escape story ran non-stop for 4 weeks. Plane crashes get equal amounts of air time.

* The militarization of the police as nation states realize the fragility of their own economies and expect civil unrest.

* This is a funny one, but progressive social progress in the US - this is the grand (and last?) compromise of government with its people to give them something to feel good about, which costs the nation nothing. (ex, pot legalization in many states in the US, federalized gay marriage and a national conversation about the inherent racism in the justice system) Immigration is still off the table, because reform could cost corporations a lot of money.



I’m sure there are many more, so feel free to add more, expand on these ideas or debunk them.
