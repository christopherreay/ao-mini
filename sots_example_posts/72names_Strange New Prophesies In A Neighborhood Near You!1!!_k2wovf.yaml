    body: "**\\[What This Is:\\]** A screenshot from a Telegram chatroom with a group\
      \ profile image of \"Le Mat\" from the Tarot of Jean Noblet,\\* found at [t.me/sotscast1](https://t.me/sotscast1)\
      \ and described as \"this is a museum \\~ plz be respectful / it is free / donations:\
      \ 50% 2 the homes0less of Ireland / 50% to $markekeller / (we r a twin flame\
      \ look it up)\"  \n\n\n\\**The three cards are very similar in paper and ink\
      \ colours, it might very well that they have been printed on the same press.\
      \ Even the pattern on the  back of the cards is identical. From left to right\
      \ we have the anonymous Tarot of Paris, created somewhere in the first half\
      \ of the 17th Century, next the Fool of Jaques Vievil, printed around 1650 and\
      \ finally the Tarot of Jean Noblet, the oldest known \"Marseille\" Tarot, created\
      \ around 1659. The Fool of Jean Noblet is mirrored with respect to the older\
      \ two Tarot Fools, to emphasize that we are not looking at an image, but that\
      \ the card is mirroring our Soul. For this reason the Fool of Noblet is walking\
      \ to the right and both others are walking to the left. The three Fools are\
      \ very similar, they all have fool's caps, a fool's stick like the jesters have\
      \ and bells attached to there clothing. All Fools are bearded.*   \n*\u2014\
