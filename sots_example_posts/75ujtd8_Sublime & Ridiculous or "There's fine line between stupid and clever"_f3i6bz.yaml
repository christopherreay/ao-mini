                  \ I posted, but I\u2019m glad I did because it satisfied a need\
                  \ to know some things I didn\u2019t know I didn\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019\
                  t looking for an answer that would corroborate a theory or anything;\

                  \ the Imaginary and Symbolic aspects of the Spectacle and that the\
                  \ Real spectacle is my objet petit a, which of course, is only partly\

                  \ how much I have \"internalized\" it or how naturalized it is in\

                  \ for being the spectacle - from within the spectacle  - is banned\
                  \ on the sub, because it simply reproduces it, but it raises the\
                  \ question, if you can\u2019t analyse the spectacle by identifying\
                  \ its various bits and pieces, something which necessarily entails\
                  \ reproducing it to some extent, what can you do? What is the recommended\
                  \ tactic in the face of the all-encompassing spectacle? Creative\
                  \ interventions I suppose, and do more reading of Debord and others\
                  \ to find out. \n\nThere is much else to say, but later; thanks\
                  \ for the conversation."

Scrolling through Reddit this morning I came across this incongruous juxtaposition in the signifying chain. One post concerned with the meaning of “Life the universe and everything,” the other, “meaningless” kitty porn. Isn’t this the spectacle in all its idiotic glory? While I could say I’m not judging, that one pursuit is not more valid than the other (‘Whatever gets you thru the night” right?), you’d probably say I’m lying. But it is certainly an indicator of the heterogeneity of our contemporary culture.
