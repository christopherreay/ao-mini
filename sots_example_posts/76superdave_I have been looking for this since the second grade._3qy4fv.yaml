  body: You're still not as cool as the person who refuses to color the dinosaur at
    all, the person who colors the dinosaur right as an ironic statement about people
    who color dinosaurs, or the person who eats the crayons while violently cursing
    god.

    body: I had a friend who ate crayons (and chalk and erasers) in grade school.
      He was violently sick. But was also punished by the teacher for his 'misbehaviour'
      (hit with a ruler. They hit him so hard the ruler broke). I can't remember the
      cursing God bit, but I imagine he cursed the teacher;)

    body: Ha!  That was my exact thought.  Nobody has seen dinosaur skin.  bones yes,
      but not living skin.  Thanks for that.  And thanks for the welcome guys.

  said color the dinosaur however you''d like.  I colored mine bright with many splotches
  of color.  It was returned to me with points subtracted because dinosaurs didn''t
  look like that.


  I''ve said for a long time that I didn''t need to find my worldview in a book or
  written down.  It was nice to find it had a name though.  I''ve been calling it
  manufactured reality.
