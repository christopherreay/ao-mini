    Have you considered not pathologizing everything to give yourself the comfort
    of "being clinical about it?"


    Do you realize that people like things for reasons other than their rationally
    calculated utility value?'

        If I''m reading you right, you''ve recently come across exceptions to this
        rule in your personal life, and you''re wondering how to account for them.
        The first thing you look for is some greater socially situated dysfunction,
        i.e. "something to do with the oppressing feelings of societal doom and ennui
        that make up modernism+"


        For about 20 years I''ve been a part of the furry fandom, which famously has
        some of the most parasocially involved fans, to the extent that the fans imagine
        themselves as parasocial entities - i.e. "fursonas."


        To be sure there is an element who is attracted to the fandom because it offers
        something that is deficient in their tangible interpersonal relationships
        with other human beings. But there is also a surprisingly high number of people
        who you would never expect to be furries from the stereotypes - people from
        all walks of life, professions, and mindsets.


        Ultimately I can only speak for myself for why the furry fandom and parasocial
        relationships are so attractive to me. I am an extremely curious and creative
        person, and parasocial relationships and entities allow for the exploration
        of speculative identity and personality - character creation and interaction
        as an art. I interpret parasocial entities as being comprised of the styles
        of self or shards of personality woven from their creators, whose own personalities
        are woven from the influences of others. Parasocial relationships as a co-creative
        art transforms "the gods" into a creative medium of co-creation and self-reflection.
        Rather than seeing the furry fandom as childish, a degeneration to a childhood
        state, I see it an evolution of identity into a sort of radically self-creative
        artform with incredible transformative potential.


        Here''s a question: what do you do when all problems have been solved, all
        wars overcome, all suffering made trivial, everything optimized? This is essentially
        the question that postmodern ennui asks endlessly without resolution. What
        can prevent a flight to producing war and destruction in order to artificially
        create problems to solve, in order to distract from the ultimate meaninglessness
        of The Struggle? The obvious answer: explore, create, and discover life and
        beauty together. Curiosity is *inexhaustible,* and so provides a heat sink
        for human activity without exploding with nihilistic self-destructivity out
        of utter boredom. Rather than giving a distraction from the meaningless of
        struggle, the triumph of curiosity gives a purpose for tolerating the meaninglessness
        of struggle: so that those numinous moments of love with others and togetherness
        with the world may be enjoyed.


        Is not curiosity the guiding light of philosophy and psychology? Curiosity
        where it exists is non-compulsory, existing for its own sake and delighting
        for its own sake, able to wander with the freedom of purposelessness. Ennui
        is the result of a curiosity that cannot successfully smell out what it needs
        to feed itself: moments of love and beauty. There are some people in this
        world who are completely fulfilled socially and psychologically, yet are compulsively
        drawn to The Unknown due to a simple love for it.


        The whole purpose of living, as far as I can tell, is to collect reasons for
        living - notice how this is a self-fulfilling prophecy, in that it seeks to
        generate the evidence that life is worth living. These reasons can be found
        in every aspect of the way we relate to the world, including those we call
        parasocial, fantastic, fictional, and speculative.


        Related: Minecraft primed an entire generation into the philosophical mindset
        that interprets experience as a wild and free domain of creative exploration,
        a game with no real goal or end. The seeds of a post-postmodern society of
        creativity can be seen in such art movements. There''s a lot more, the entire
        internet has been essentially one giant parasocial hyperaccellerator / interdimensional
        gateway to the world of demons (parasocial entities) and that''s a good thing
        because it''s allowing mass radical experimentation with speculative identity
        and relationships.'

  body: "Also Freud talked about this using the term *weltanshauung*, \"a world apart\"\
    . A second, representational world, such as the fictional universe of a story,\
    \ in which our libidinal forces play out but in which, according to Freud, any\
    \ personal growth we fantasize about in the story does not apply to us, and is\
    \ essentially lost at the conclusion of the story.\n\nHowever, Joseph Campbell\
    \ for example would certainly disagree. I myself think that stories can educate\
    \ us, help us grow in emotional and social intelligence, and provide scaffolding\
    \ for thought. It seems like people consume the kind of story they need for where\
    \ they are in their psychological growth. Eventually, they get enough of that\
    \ kind of story and look for something a little more complex or emotionally mature.\
    \ However, if someone is not interested in growth or complexity, they might use\
