  body: "No, it's VERY deliberate, although there are a lot of various meanings sort\
    \ of jammed in there. Land's \"Jargo-plexing\" (folding jargon in on itself) is\
    \ often like that, especially in CCRU Writings where everything is kind of written\
    \ in this beautiful, hermitic style. \n\nSo Hummpa-Taddum is representative of\
    \ \"Pisces\" (amongst other things, more on that in a sec) the astrological age\
    \ we are currently in. The symbol of Pisces \u2653 depicts two fish tied together,\
    \ a sort of Janus \"two faced\" wishy washy sign that sits on top of his Wall\
    \ like the pompous bureaucrat-priest that he is, where he can decide what words\
    \ mean what, whenever he wants. \n\n> \"Must a name mean something?\" Alice asks.\
    \ \n\n> \u201CWhen I use a word,\u201D Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful\
    \ tone, \u201Cit means just what I choose it to mean \u2013 neither more nor less.\u201D\
    \n\nBut now with the internet and digital codes, we can SMASH that stupid egg\
    \ man to bits (COLLAPSE his manipulative two-facedness into one solid thing) because\
    \ operational semiotics like URL and Y2K mean exactly what they ***DO!*** [(See\
    \ this snippet from Land's Bitcoin paper for a little more on that)](https://i.imgur.com/ZfjTEgF.png)\n\
    \n> Hummpa, the Great Babylonian Worm was coupled with the Celestial Logos Taddum,\
    \ initiating the age of Pisces which is now rushing towards its unbirth.\n\nSo\
    \ here, \"Hummpa\" the \"Great Worm\" of Babylon probably refers to the Hammurabi\
    \ code, one of the oldest surviving legal texts to implement a policy of punishing\
    \ the perp over compensating the victim (an eye for an eye leaves the whole world\
    \ blind), and \"Great Worm\" probably refers to the act of re-reading and reinterpreting\
    \ \"Holy Books\". In Land's Bitcoin paper, he says: \n\n> The Law of the WORM\
    \ - Write Once Read Many (times)\n\n[~Section \xA73.421 ](https://etscrivner.github.io/cryptocurrent/)\n\
    \n\"Taddum\" & \"The Celestial Logos\"... I'm not sure how those phrases come\
    \ together, paging u/raisondecalcul for help.\n\nI made a meme about this a while\
    \ ago, check out this thread:\nhttps://twitter.com/PulsatingShadow/status/1381743989544644608?s=19\n\
    \nIf that still doesn't make any sense, let me know, I'll try to explain it another\
    \ way when I have time."

    body: That's great actually, I think you've covered it. I've more or less been
      reading the CCRU stuff and some preceding Land in chronological order and some
      of these "jargoplexes" have been a stumbling block. Do you reckon there's some
      background reading outside this I'm missing or should I carry on?

      body: Land covers a huge amount of ground, I feel like I'm going to spend the
        rest of my life spiraling through the decimal labyrinth he's cooked up (or
        was it always already there?), but you can check out my [CCRU primer playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC_87I4vjVQP0QHaxEbIE5IP-4Dx2o-9L),
        you might find some things of help there. (I added a little more to my original
        post as well)

      All I''ve got is that "Taddum" sounds like td = 2 followed by tn = 9. Another
      word that also sounds similar and translate the same way is "thetan".'
