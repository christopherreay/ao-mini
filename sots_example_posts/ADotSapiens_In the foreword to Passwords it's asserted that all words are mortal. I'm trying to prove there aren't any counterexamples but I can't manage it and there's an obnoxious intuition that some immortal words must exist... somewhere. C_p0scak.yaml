  body: They are mortal because all words are made in the mind of man. The word is
    just a mapping in our brain as a building brick of consciousness to create an
    understanding of the world.

  body: 'Communication cannot be immortal because all communication is communicated
    from a specific place at a specific time for a particular purpose, with the value
    of a communication gradually reducing in relevance. A re-communication is a re-contextualization
    from one situation to another, such that a component of novel apprehension is
    irremovable from it. A communication is an organic process, and as such it is
    necessarily mortal.


    What is unchanging and immortal about communication isn''t any particular communication-object,
    but rather what is communicated by the act of communicating, and this communication
    is extremely close to the nature of life itself. It is an immortal praxis, a method
    of methods and a technique of techniques common to all living processes. It is
    the creative methodology of biological evolution, with the understanding that
    the adventures of the mind and of feeling are evolutionary adventures. What is
    spoken by the act of communication and the act of living is a primordial grasping-towards
    of an organism towards its potentiality, an implicit faith in the possibility
    of life to find life that animates all living action. This communication isn''t
    in words, but is rather an immortal feeling of liveliness, of the growing together
    of the world, the feeling of The Unknown. This feeling is felt most greatly in
    experiences of awe at the reception of great wonder and/or horror, those rare
    moments of threshold-crossing where one''s entire experience and interpretation
    of the world is altered by the encounter of some awesome phenomenon. Such experiences
    are the cause of all religious and spiritual sentiment, magnificent facts of nature
    requiring magnificent methods of explanation to satisfyingly communicate. I have
    found the language of change and creativity - the language of evolution - as the
    framework that has allowed me to most powerfully speak of this "spiritual" facts
    of facts, sometimes referred to as "The Mystery." Can you imagine changing the
    world through words?'

selftext: I've gotten to Seduction and have had to stop and reassess things for three
  days because this is jamming up my thoughts. I can't resolve it sober or otherwise
  but the last thing I want to do here is reinvent platonism. I'm posting here because
  I respect you guys a bit more than all of the other internet people.
spoiler: false
title: In the foreword to Passwords it's asserted that all words are mortal. I'm trying
  to prove there aren't any counterexamples but I can't manage it and there's an obnoxious
  intuition that some immortal words must exist... somewhere. Can I get replies that
  might help me work through this?
