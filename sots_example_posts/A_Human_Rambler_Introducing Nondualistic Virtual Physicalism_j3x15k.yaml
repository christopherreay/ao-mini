 My overarching philosophy is called Nondualistic Virtual Physicalism.

All is one.  The mind is imaginary.  The physical universe makes sense.

There is a lot to unpack there and it’s difficult to formulate the ideas in such a way that they can be easily consumed.  This stream of consciousness project has the goal of simulating my person.  At the very least it will be possible to generate similar text using artificial intelligence.  Ultimately I’d like to create a virtual avatar that will persist after I’m dead.

I’ll start with physicalism because it is the closest to the mainstream understanding of how the universe works.  This is a more refined perspective than materialism, in that it holds that the universe changes over time in predictable ways.  This isn’t determinism because at the quantum scale there is an element of uncertainty.  At the macro scale, the universe follows predictable laws that can be understood and used to create an accurate model of behavior.

While physicalism focuses on the physical, it is an incomplete perspective of the universe.  The nonphysical things still exist as information, created by configurations of energy.

This is where virtualism comes in.  The idea of separating the physical from the mental is a classic dualistic approach.  We can view the universe as being solely subjective.  That the only reason the universe exists is that we are here to observe it.  Consciousness is the most interesting virtual system we know of.  The subjective perspective is the image of information about the observable universe.

Virtualism focuses on the ideas and meaning.  There exist ideas that are independent of any one person thinking them.  The potential of spacetime allows for all possible thoughts.

This bifurcation of the universe into physical and virtual is a system for understanding.  This is a duality that is inherently flawed because everything is interconnected.

Nondualism is necessary to integrate these two perspectives.  The two systems for understanding phenomena are limited, but when combined they form a whole universal pattern.

Nonduality is difficult to explain because it is as much a state of mind as it is an idea.  Everything in the universe can be thought of as being a unified whole.  There is no actual difference between me and you because we are essentially the same energy.

Unifying the physical and virtual into a universal perspective is possible.

The difficulty with reconciling these two perspectives is that they are separate systems for understanding.  The physical spacetime allows for the configuration of energy which holds the potential for all information.  The virtual conscious perspective manifests the universe through the realization of existence.  The two systems are different points of view of the same universe.

That’s the idea.  If we can integrate these two valid perspectives we can attain a more complete understanding of the whole.

Let’s start from the beginning of the subjective perspective because that is all we know.  The human condition has been consistent throughout history.  Each of us shares similar genetics and a similar world.  There are vast differences between individuals, but the similarities are greater.

We learn patterns that associate incoming stimuli to concepts.  Our mind is effectively a biological computer that has developed an abstract association of concepts.  We can examine the biology of simpler organisms to gain a better understanding of our fundamental nature.  In order to understand the ego, we have developed psychology.

So we grow up and learn how we think the world works.  This function has been necessary to our survival.  Human civilization has reached a point where the old survival mechanisms are no longer beneficial to the world.  Our perspective needs to evolve.

We developed sciences and through the scientific method, we can approximate models for physical systems.  This is incredibly effective, but limited.

Religion came before science and tried to explain the universe.  These beliefs are the best guesses of humanity about the unknowns.  There needs to be a balance between the speculation of ideas and the limitations of our understanding.

We can formulate valid universal perspectives, but that doesn’t make them accurate.  From our finite point of view, we are limited in our processing.  We cannot comprehend the universal pattern all at once.  We can grasp the fractal nature of reality and extrapolate the pattern onto the rest of existence, but this is limited.

The trouble is that each subjective perspective is valid while being incomplete.  A theoretical God perspective would be able to understand the whole of the universe.  If a perspective was able to experience every conscious being, it would effectively be omniscient.

One metaphysical issue is the origin of the universe.  I would argue that we cannot gain information about the state previous to the singularity.  Our understanding of the early universe is limited to the observable phenomenon and physical models.  Speculation is necessary to further our model.  It may be that the universe is the way it is because of an evolutionary process of the initial expansion of the singularity finding a stable state.

We can postulate that an objective physical universe exists.

We should also take the approach of skepticism, that objectivity doesn’t really exist.

From this contention, we should explore both sides.  

This is a personal exploration though, I don’t seek to convince you of either position.
