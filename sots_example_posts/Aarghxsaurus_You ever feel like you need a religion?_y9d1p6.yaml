  body: Relate to this a lot, brother (or sister). Sometimes I can't help but think
    this feeling is one of the defining characteristics of modern life. It's tough
    to deal with.

    body: So what are we to do then? I don't want to spend my entire life wallowing
      in this desire. In fact, I think a lot of people (probably even some here!)
      are satisfied with the mere realization that we are fucked, and I don't want
      to end up like that.

    body: 'Hail Eris!  Honestly, reading the Principia Discordia and then The Illuminatus!
      trilogy when I was a teenager was the first time I felt understood.  I was lucky
      enough to live in the Portland of Old at the time, where the 24 Hour Church
      of Elvis and the Roxy were still gathering places for the strange and unusual.


      For me it was like studying industrial noise and experimental music, everything
      from Merzbow to Philip Glass to John Cage.  From then on I was free to find
      the beauty in everything.  And from studying Discordia and other strangeness
      I was free to find meaning in the meaningless.


      Facing my own Shadow was also immensely freeing, and my name here "talanton"
      is Greek for balance so my path is a mix of the "right hand" and "left hand"
      paths.'

  body: I felt like atheism alone wasn't fully scratching the itch, so during lockdown
    I turned more towards the left hand path, unaffiliated atheistic Satanism and
    Chaos magick. I'm still an empiricist at heart, so I think these things are autosuggestion
    and psychological in nature, a kind of open source shamanism that you can formulate
    however you want.

    sort of thing. Hate to say it but I also think Hegel is at least a little bit
    onto something with all his talking about universality and absolute spirit, and
    maybe this is just another path up the same mountain. And maybe the mountain just
    keeps getting taller all the time, and it''s just about climbing towards something,
    without ever arriving, becoming climbing the mountain. I don''t know. I think
    something is going to emerge. I think an *idea* is going to emerge which will
    spread in how the collective consciousness of the internet judges it to be satisfactory.
    Solve for X.


    What is a basic idea everyone will finally agree on someday? maybe there won''t
    be any kind of settling, but there are universal forms, such as the body. we all
    have bodies. everyone, no matter what weird beliefs they have or what strange
    theory they read, whatever opinions they have about hegel or deleuze or spinoza
    or marx or god or *what*ever\*,\* we all have bodies which need water, food, safety,
    shelter, basic needs. basic embodied  needs. and the body even has a lot of feelings
    we can all discuss how to feel. and you know what''s interesting, especially amongst
    people who talk a lot about "the life of the mind" is how little we talk about
    "the body itself as a foundation for theory".  sorry, maybe i am getting off track
    here a little bit. but I think something everyone could believe in is universally
    making bodies healthier. it''s a nice thought. maybe that''s another side of the
    mountain for you. the mind is in the body, the mind is on the body, the body is
    the container for the mind, and where is that theory? the universality of embodied
    spirit...well. yeah. not totally universal. but maybe something close. spirit
    needs bodies to express itself...'

      yeah you could totally be a physicist without knowing math it''s kind of absurd
      but it''s true.

      That''s why there''s philosophy at all and then there''s matter physics there''s

      will is how you solve for you know shit that don''t make sense.


      How do you live in this freaking crazy ass world and you know still try to get
      along with people? The thing is the getting along part would have an automatically
      you know if we drop the asshole part and it start to see people as being equal

    There are some churches/sects that lean more secular, or at the very least, are
    comfortable welcoming atheists/agnostics. Look around.


    Find places to serve or give. Homeless shelters, animal shelters, etc. Try it
    once and see how it goes.


    Finally, explore some secular spirituality. Hinduism and Buddhism make it easier,
    but it is possible to reconcile atheism and themes of abrahamic religions too.
    Eckhart Tolle speaks to some, and repulses others. Look around and see if you
    find something that resonates with you.


    Finally, remember that our paradigms cloud our vision. We think we see the world
    as it is; but we often see the world as we are. This has pros and cons. If we
    choose to focus on our decaying bodies, then we will find decay. If we choose
    to focus on building community and spirituality, we will probably find those.
    If you want purpose, you will likely have to *choose* to have it.


    Good luck.'

Not sure where to post this, but you people seem to be the right audience for my post.

I more and more feel like there is a gaping hole in my slowly dying and rotting body. Maybe it's just because I'm young, or because I'm lonely, but I just don't see anything in modern society that could ever help me with this. I am a very "progressive" person, so I probably won't regularly show up at my local church or mosque, since these places aren't always accepting of trans people or open to ideas outside of their own (that being said, Islam interests me much more than Christianity).  


To be clear, I do believe in god. Not a personal god, but a spinozist sort of force, but that's not relevant to this discussion.  


I'm not sure how I can describe this desire, I don't know what produces it exactly, but it just feels like no one around me believes in anything. Even leftists or religious people I know just seem to be cynical, to not have any sort of positive spiritual hope or connection. Everyone is depressed, ironic, cynical, dead inside. Now I can't see into the minds of these people, and maybe they do have this bond, but I don't see it, and I can't leave this matrix alone.   


I don't feel part of a culture, of a country, of a community, or even honestly of a class, even though I am actively working in its interest. Maybe in a different, older world, I would fully live through being a nun, a socialist or something like that, but this isn't this world. This is the world where the friends who like fight club or Communism seem just as """realistic""" (i.e. cynical and depressed) than everyone else, and where I feel purposeless and lonely.
