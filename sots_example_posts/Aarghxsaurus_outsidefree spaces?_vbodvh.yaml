        is different and the inside looking out and seeing hey what you are doing

  body: 'I had a convo not that long ago with some younger people about exactly this.
    I was trying to convince them that gatekeeping is really a morally neutral set
    of activities wich can sometimes be used for good, since it keeps counter-cultural
    spaces radical as well as safe for maginalized people


    I wonder whether the pervasiveness of "fast culture" with social media like tiktok
    makes these cultural spaces harder to stake out. The gen z people I was talking
    to had a very strong reaction against me invoking the idea of "posers" where gen
    x''rs would I think have understood and sympathized with callig out people for
    only aesthetically "trying on" a subculture without actually living its ethos.
    Obviously this would go double for counter-cultures (which by design run counter
    to the prevaling mass-media capitalist sphere) since not living the "counter-"
    part prevents that cultural moment from being radically prefigurative in a meaningful
    way'

          psychedelics wouldn't call themselves psychonauts, just like many people
          who smoke herb really hate being associated with stoners, or with the general
          boring and shitty subculture around smoking weed (watching shitty stoner
          comedies who are all exactly the same, eating bad fast food, being dudebros,

            Yes, people with these features exist, but are any of these features really
            that bad? Is there really something wrong with going schizo for a few
            years with psychedelic use, or getting stoned and eating fast food in
            your teens? Most eventually grow out of that.


            My point was that there exist really interesting and authentic people
            among psychedelic and drug users, as well as interesting projects and
            initiative - both what you describe and the inverse exist among that group.'

        body: I genuinely enjoy the psychedelic experience, as well as sharing it.
          But it's also crystal clear that the "subculture" if you want to call it
          that has been commodified to death. A good real-life example would be the
          absolute fucking decay of festivals in the neoliberal economy. I used to
          be a very avid festival-goer (I still rly appreciate the small ones), but
          all the popular ones pretty much make me want to puke. Another good example
          is the stagnation of the psychedelic aesthetic. If you look at album covers
          from the 60s there was something genuinely novel about them, which captures
          people to this day. But after that it has essentially been copy of copy
          of copy. H&M is making billions selling Woodstock shirts and hippie aesthetic
          to young people who only really come into contact with it as a vague popcultural
          reference point, an empty signifier. So yeah, I hope you can see where I
          am getting at here, and that I really don't have a problem with psychedelics
          inherently, but rather with how the culture around it transformed.

            \ from psychedelics and co opt wider acceptance to make a few dollars,\
            \ but by no means do I or will I choose to throw my hands up and say *it's\
            \ done, it's commercialized, and sprinkle salt all over my own experience\
            \ or into the minds of others\".\n\n >I used to be a very avid festival-goer\
            \ (I still rly appreciate the small ones), but all the popular ones pretty\
            \ much make me want to puke.\n\nI'm a burner myself and have been to a\
            \ number of festivals that are more or less commercialized. I grate at\
            \ the commercialization present in most of them, but can still enjoy the\
            \ music or scene in general. Just the same, I am wary of influencers and\
            \ other opportunists that want to use the burn as a platform. There is\
            \ a cultural battle going on here where consensus is being shaped to help\
            \ reject this *threat* to something that is intentionally divorced from\
            \ commercialization and yet has to constantly fend it off.\n\nThere are\
            \ lots of burners who say the burn stopped being fun or cool or whatever\
            \ else in this year or that, but it's still an incredible experience unlike\
            \ most anything else and they are the ones missing out now. \n\n>Another\
            \ good example is the stagnation of the psychedelic aesthetic. \n\nThis\
            \ is also reductionist. There are so many artists out there who are playing\
            \ with elements of that aesthetics but with new mediums, forms, or with\
            \ their own unique combination of styles. I dont even know where to start\
            \ because it's not stagnant at all. Check out Jen Stark\n\nAnd if you\
            \ want to look at it as an aesthetic movement, is impressionism any less\
            \ enjoyable because it's a century old? If a new artist picked up a brush\
            \ and painted their own thing in an old style, is it less enjoyable? I\
            \ certainly dont think so.\n\nIf you're looking for *novel* then that's\
            \ something entirely different.\n\nIn the meantime, H&M selling shirts\
            \ with psychedelic imagery on them doesnt harm me or lessen my appreciation\
            \ of the aesthetic in any way. If anything, it makes me think that it\
            \ could be good that more people are being exposed to the imagery and\
            \ can begin to consider its origins. Wal-Mart does sell Pink Floyd and\
            \ Hendrix shirts after all. Does that make their music any less valuable\
            \ or impactful?\n\nYou choose what power you give these commercial outfits\
            \ over your day to day and over your enjoyment of these things. Maybe\
            \ youve given them too much.\n\n>but rather with how the culture around\
            \ it transformed.\n\nMy community is vibrant, healthy, supportive, intimate,\
            \ and enjoying the heck out of the trip. I am very happy with the culture\
            \ I see around psychedelics - though no less aware that  I need to be\
            \ wary of broader or harmful narratives, abuses and misconceptions that\
            \ can drive it all off the rails.\n\nWhat's more, I am aware of the *good*\
            \ that psychedelics could cause as that experience weaves its way through\
            \ the zeitgeist. That is what I'm hoping for/working towards.\n\nWhat\

            often male, with an unexamined faith.


            The truth? I''m trans, British, and converted for philosophical reasons.
            Psychedelics sent me down the road of Love, and converting to the faith
            that literally views God as Love was the next logical step.


            Why would someone assume that someone like me can''t have faith? Because
            of certain "Christians" finding far too much joy in playing the role of
            Accuser. It''s a shitshow. We have to start doing better.

  body: 'Regional burning man events are, by principal, decomodified. It''s one of
    the "ten principals of burning man". That being said, the larger events, such
    as burning man itself, tend to have a hidden capitalist underbelly where people
    use money to hire other people to set up their camps, and things like this. But
    smaller regional burns usually don''t suffer from this so much.


    In general however the community tries to decommodify things where they can. I
    remember my first burn being very confusing, like a culture shock. I didn''t understand
    why strangers were offering me food without exchanging money or serving drinks
    at a bar to whomever had a cup.


    It really feels magical, and of course it isn''t absolutely free of capitalism
    since you have to buy a ticket to get there, but I think seeing it actually work
    even for just a couple days within that isolated environment was what really woke
    me up to how toxic commodification can be for our society.'

  body: 'Black Metal. I know, I know, Cradle of Filth etc right? But the underground
    doesn''t listen to those bands and everybody that''s a part of it can spot a poser
    in a heartbeat. You would likely call it gatekeeping and tell me to "let people
    enjoy things" and I do. I make no attempt to stop anyone from listening to sell
    out fake mass produced black metal bands and industry plants, nor would I even
    be able to stop them if I wanted. But I nor anyone else in the subculture would
    ever call it black metal and it would never have any respect in these circles.
    Black metal is anticommercial to the core, to the point that basically any band
    that allows their art to become commercialized is immediately thrown out of the
    group. It seems mean but these are the extremes a group must go to in order to
    remain true to itself. You must not allow the corruption of wealth and manipulation
    to get anywhere near the group and so the group must be highly selective by default.
    Probably a very unpopular opinion but its true.


    The most well known and universally liked trve black metal band around is Darkthrone
    and that''s because they''ve been around for decades and have never compromised,
    to the point that both members of the band continue to have to work normal jobs
    in order to get by, despite being known around the world.


    Those truly metal bands who do manage to live solely from record sales and concerts
    still maintain a middle or lower class lifestyle because the audience, though
    spread wide across the world, is comparatively teeny tiny compared to the audience
    for more mainstream styles and groups. This applies outside of black metal, of
    course. I mean look at the spotify numbers of VERY famous, mainstream, commercial  pop-metal
    acts like Metallica and compare them to a current pop star like Harry Styles.
    The difference is insane, and that is probably the biggest and most famous mainstream
    metal act there ever was.


    Then look at something like Darkthrone''s numbers. Posers and metalheads alike
    love Darkthrone but even still, the numbers are meak. Darkthrone is to Metallica
    what Metallica is to Harry Styles. They can try as hard as they can and they''ll
    never make money from true black metal. Ever. That means pretty much anyone doing
    it won''t be doing it for the money.'

What are some "cultures" or "subcultures" that, in your opinion, have created a space free or resistant to commercialisation and restricting "bourgeois" norms?   
This is not a question about an ideal communist society that lives in the middle of our society, but an interrogation on how you personally, or with a community, have found avenues to a more liberated (whatever that may mean to you) way of life.
