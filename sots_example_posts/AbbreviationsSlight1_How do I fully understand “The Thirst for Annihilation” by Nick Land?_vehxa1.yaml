  body: If you've gone so far down the rabbit hole that you actually read this book
    you already know all the easy stuff, but without knowing what you took away from
    it it's hard to push you towards anything specific... I guess one (actually two)
    thing I see people leave by the wayside is that Kant and Heidegger are central
    for Land and it really makes everything much clearer if you've done your due diligence
    with them.

I’ve finished reading this book, and I just want to be sure I interpreted it correctly. I’ll probably read it again sometime, to get it better.
