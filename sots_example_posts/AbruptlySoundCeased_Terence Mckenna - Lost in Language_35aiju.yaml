  body: It's such a tragedy that he was gone too soon. I think he would have struck
    up a fascinating conversation around Deleuze with the likes of Erik Davis, Graham
    Harman and some of the Object Oriented Ontology crowd. He was simply too far ahead
    of his time. Basically every new thought that I come up with was a mere banal
    anecdote to McKenna.
