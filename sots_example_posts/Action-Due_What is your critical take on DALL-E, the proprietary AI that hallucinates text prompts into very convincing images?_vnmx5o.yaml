    body: '[The company admits](https://github.com/openai/dalle-2-preview/blob/main/system-card.md#stereotypes)
      that DALL-E portrays "nurse" as mostly women and "ceo" as men. I''m telling
      you not because this is necessarily the wrong answer.

      It reflects reality. At least the reality of its dataset.


      AI is really just its dataset. I mean 80% of dalle 2 images are lit like stock
      photos.


      I wonder then, if AI culture becomes widespread we could be seeing our biases
      fed back to us, endlessly? I mean each of already propagate our own biases,
      but now we have mechanical monkeys mixing and matching photos from years ago
      into rooms, places, and people that have never existed. It''s new but it''s
      really just phantoms of the past.


      Does AI development get new datasets, at least prune biases at least as quick
      as humans do?'

      \ entertainment company after Comcast Corporation, has long deferred its story-making\
      \ processes to artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. In 2017, the company\
      \ used AI \u201Cneural networks\u201D to scan a database of stories from the\
      \ answer site Quora, interpreting upvotes as \u201Ca proxy for narrative quality\u201D\
      \ and analyzing the highest-rated posts for consistent structures and events\
      \ that could explain user popularity. The goal of this analysis was to finetune\
      \ Disney\u2019s attempts to predict the popularity of certain content and forms.\
      \ In this regard, the company has also utilized factorized variational autoencoders,\
      \ or FVAEs, to film the facial responses of viewers during screenings in order\
      \ to predict emotional reactions to onscreen events, and therefore use this\
      \ information to generate stories that more addictively manipulate the consumer\u2019\
      s emotions.  \nEmotional manipulation is a crucial component of film, the advertising\
      \ industry, and mass marketing in general, but the technocratization of this\
      \ manipulation is reaching new heights with the ubiquity of behavioral analysis\
      \ and cybernetic feedback technologies that seek to create \u201Cpersonalized\
      \ viewing experiences\u201D for their consumers. That is, in essence, viewers\

    \ will not be able to do more than offer advice.  Maybe even good advice.  Maybe\
    \ good enough advice that executives can be automated away.  \n\nBut to do that\
    \ you would have to create an AI that could understand a social context and its\

      I have a neurological condition that affects my perception as well as my ability
      to visualize. Being able to render visualizations with words when my brain can
      no longer visualize properly is an amazing tool, and I can only imagine how
      amazing such a tool is for people who were never able to create images from
      their thoughts in the first place.


      The person above talking about how images have always been created from other
      images has never rung truer, but I do feel like this is akin to people at the
      turn of the 20th century decrying modern photography being useless and/or a
      threat to supplanting traditional media.'

    body: I think making an image based on a prompt *is* an interpretation. The thing
      it's not doing is *re*-interpreting the interpretations on an ongoing basis.
      If you had DALL-E render itself and then integrate that rendering into its neural
      net going forward, and then keep doing that, then that would resemble "ongoing
      interpretation" and might lead to something weirdly more closely resembling
      reflexive intelligence.

        body: Wow awesome. Yeah, that seems very close to dreaming. The reflexivity
          and intentionality of the generation of the dream images is the main thing
          that's missing. The dream images are not relating to each other in any way
          over time. The people at the beach are frozen in beach-poses, they are not
          moving over time in beach ways. The images are not being generated (and
          therefore biased) for any particular reason. It seems like these are the
          only remaining differences between this AI and something we'd call a real
          living (if perhaps not conscious) agent. I bet the military already has
          more advanced AIs that apply data in ongoing reevaluations like this...
          there is never a more important time to reevaluate then when you are a robot
          holding a gun. They probably already have Westworld season 3 style AIs to
          manage the world then (certainly may as well with big data), or they will
          very soon (like the last story in *I, Robot* by Asimov).

  body: 'I think it''s great!! There''s not much bad to say about something so  fun
    and amazing. Obviously from a Foulcauldian perspective, there is the risk that
    the images produced will be deeply and systematically biased based on the input
    data. But theoretically, I think that doesn''t actually apply much here! The reason
    is simply that for an AI to be able to make *any* described image using what ultimately
    amounts to a very complex spreadsheet, it has to have at a bare minimum n^2 microcategories
    for everything. That means that it doesn''t just have a category for fingernails,
    it has categories for every shape you could imagine cutting a fingernail into.
    This thing has had SO MUCH data run through it that it would be relatively difficult
    to intentionally censor the data in an intended way. Any major censorship would
    be detectable by making the AI "stupid" in a certain way. For example if you censored
    all images or reference to politics in the AI, you wouldn''t be able to generate
    images of known politicians or images of podiums or things like that, it would
    smear and instead show you something else related. So I think if we get censorship
    in these AIs, plenty of people are going to notice and write about it. It will
    be more just the background of the tool rather than a major defining feature of
    the tool. There will be multiple competing art AIs and open-source versions of
    art AIs, and one of the things they will compete on is articulation, the ability
    to paint any very specific thing you describe. Censoring the AI simply means blocking
    off some possibilities as to what it can or will render. So people who want to
    generate political images or certain topical images will simply be able to use
    an open-source AI or one that is specialized for creating their sort of disruptive
    images. You could spin up your own AI and train it on an unbiased data set.


    I think it''s great that people like me, who have never invested the time to become
    visual artists, will be able to produce high-quality images from their imagination.
    This is really an amazing tool for sharing our inner worlds and ideas with each
    other. For creating ads/propaganda that can compete with well-funded campaigns
    that can hire graphic designers. I think it does a lot more overall to level the
    playing field than it does to create new opportunities for oppression, because
    it''s already the case that large organizations with money can create all the
    real or fake images they want.


    Oh I do really hate the lines they are having people publicly wait in though.
    Bastards should just open-source it. Yes I know you need supercomputers, it should
    still be open-source.'

      body: 'A data set with nothing intentionally removed, that contains as much
        diverse and varied data as possible. Data may need to be coherent enough for
        the AI to learn from, so that may limit sources somewhat, but overall I think
        you can just feed it the internet.


        In constructing samples of people for use in human studies, there are various
        techniques used to create an unbiased data set. One technique is random selection.
        However for small sample sizes, such as when you have a rare condition and
        only a few patients in the study, this might not be possible. In this case,
        one technique is to match up each person in the experimental group with someone
        in the control group. Match them up on other factors like age, BMI, diet,
        etc. besides the experimental factor. This makes the two groups closer together
        so that only the experimental factor stands out in the experimental data.
        In this case, the "less bias" means cleaning up the data so that the experiment
        (or AI) can learn from it better, based on the question we are asking. So
        in the case of an AI, depending on the context, unbiased data may be intentionally
        biased from an absolute perspective, but in order to make it possible to train
        a certain type of AI. In this case, the bias introduced depends on the question
        asked, so care and criticality should be applied in constructing specialized
        AIs, and tests should be done to see if the resulting AI has blind spots (although
        if it''s just used for its specialization, maybe it doesn''t matter).


        So mainly I mean a data set that isn''t intentionally censored.'

    body: 'You used to have to commission an artist to create them for you though,
      and the process would take some time. Dalle-2 makes it almost instantaneous.


      Compare it to GPT-3 (text generating AI): it''s even easier to get someone to
      write bad copy-writing for you than it is to get a graphical artist or photo
      editor to create pictures for you. Yet text generating AIs have scaled it up,
      flooding the web with meaningless AI-generated webpages, that some people mistake
      for real websites.


      In other words: cars have existed in one form or another since the invention
      of the chariot, but that didn''t stop mass produced automobiles from having
      an impact on our society. Scale, cost and ease of use matter. We should be careful
      not to underestimate the impact those changes can have (and also not to over-hype
      them).'
