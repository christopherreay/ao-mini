  body: 'Subjectivity is everything we are aware of experientially. But it''s not
    what most people think of when they think of subjectivity. In particular it''s
    nothing like an anti-pole of ''objectivity''. Nor does it reside somewhere in
    particular, like in a mind or brain. Subjectivity is just another endlessly diffuse
    field effect with relative, localized concentrations, sort of like gravity. The
    fact is that there are, within the universe, pockets of intense experiential awareness.
    Those pockets are not individuals; they are _communities_. We live within one.


    We live on, and are are materially part of, an epistemic ''reef''. The things
    whose value we debate or whose truth we seek to establish depend upon a vast array
    of already-settled-truths and values that no one thinks to question anymore. The
    latter are the parts of the reef, the bedrock, that has already calcified. The
    living part of the reef are the questions we are engaged with, which are still
    unsettled and ''in play''. So, subjectivity is a process of extruding and producing
    truth. Over time some of that truth ''hardens'' and builds out part of the reef
    that subsequent generations will use as a foothold from which to generate their
    own extrusions. That is the process. But the reef isn''t permanent _per se_. Sometimes
    pieces of the reef get broken, or are dissolved, or simply break off and float
    away entirely never to be seen again.


    The environment, i.e. reality, is hostile and indifferent - by which I mean that
    exposure to it will kill you given enough time. It doesn''t have anything to do
    with truth or with the reef. This makes reality much, much more than a context
    ("context" is actually just a kind of benign atmosphere generated by the reef).
    The reef is the means by which we are able to survive being adrift in the environment
    for any length of time at all - it''s our spacesuit and spaceship all in one.
    But we aren''t in control of reality. We may navigate it and explore it tentatively,
    and indeed we have to. But it''s dangerous. That''s why here in SoTS we are making
    a map.'

  body: 'I think subjectivity is a dimension of consciousness, or an element of consciousness.


    I see it as such, consciousness emanates from the "black sun". The black sun could
    be seen as the original source of energy at the beginning of time, outside of
    time actually. This energy is reflected in all things of the material world and
    this original emanation is the Spirit of the universe that we all came from. This
    is also know as Kether on the tree of life. This creative force is then focused
    through our mental lens (with two sides a front and back or masculine and feminine),
    into a focal point. The lens or perspective that most accurately defines this
    eternal source of light is able to absorb (understand) and warp (will) the most
    light and therefore focus the most intent of their will from that light onto the
    conscious plane, in the form of transformation, evolution, learning, illumination
    aka Fire.


    In other words, seeing and understanding the universe around you allows you to
    have more control over parameters that effect your experience.


    I think consciousness is an expression of the collective, infinite consciousness,
    shattering itself into an infinite pieces, hiding it''s true identity in the material
    world of this dimension, and using this brief moment of amnesia in order to test
    certain aspects of itself and to rewrite the love story of the universe over and
    over. We are here to convert vices into virtues and dark into light. We have an
    insatiable lust for language and stories and that is what we are here to do against
    all odds. Upping the ante each time.


    There will always be a paradox in the realms ruled by Saturn as the clock ticks
    to measure the infinite. I will always be me and we at once.'

      What is subjectivity, and what is consciousness, in your conception?

      Interesting. My issue with this conception is the idea that you are a being
      in the universe and it is a thing around you. I think that''s rooted in misconceptualizing
      the self/subjectivity as equal to the body, or inside the body. I think the
      body and the body''s environment (the universe) are both conceptions and experiences
      inside your mind, in a manner of speaking.

      That''s an interesting narrative. Sincerely. Do you view this as the only valid
      narrative, or are other narratives valid too? i.e. Do you think that if you
      took a different high-level narrative and focused on believing it, that it would
      start to seem real to you and your world would begin to conform to it? Or do
      you think people who believe other narratives are in some way wrong?


      Do you believe this view is the truth? Why or why not?'

  body: "Very provacatively- and well-put question.\n\nI like how you eloquently reference\
    \ a synthesis of western philosophy by linking phenomenological *intent* with\
    \ the subjective sphere.\n\nYou've probably noticed this about me by now but I\
    \ can't resist a good question, or even just a question mark. So watch while I\
    \ neurotically answer every question.\n\n> Do you think you are a subject, a mind?\n\
    \nBasically, yes. But technically there is no way to know whether the thinker\
    \ is the person, or the body or brain or mind. The location of mind is nowhere\
    \ and everywhere so there is no linking it with certainty with any particular\
    \ physical phenomenon. I might be a tomato or cricket I saw once, that dreamed\
    \ the rest of the universe from my point of view (i.e., the default point of view\
    \ is \"to see a tomato once, which was me\").\n\n> Are you experiencing? Are you\
    \ believing? Are you intending?\n\nYes, or minimally, experience is happening.\
    \ That's a truism, a tautalogy. **EXPERIENCE.**\n\nI believe but I try not to.\
    \ (\"I don't want to believe\".) It doesn't work\u2014the harder I try not to\
    \ believe, the more I convince myself of the value of belief (as a tool).\n\n\"\
    I am intending\" is just a sentence construction. It depends on what it means.\
    \ For example, I really like the way Heidegger constructs the idea of intent and\
    \ how it undergirds the phenomenal world ('*care*'), and I basically agree that\
    \ it seems like a good idea of what's going on. But I can't verify that I \"intend\"\
    \ because what would that even mean? How would I verify that I do this very abstract\
    \ definition that Heidegger made? It depends on the verb construction of the sentence:\
    \ first I would have to find this thing called \"I\" and then I would have to\
    \ define precisely what counts as intending\u2014most likely there would be an\
    \ object of intention. So then I have to verify some kind of intent interaction\
    \ between the subject and the object\u2014and now the whole thing has lost its\
    \ magic. There is no connecting that data with whether people actually intend\
    \ things or just look exactly like they do but have something else going on in\
    \ their subjective experience. Even if I could prove it for myself there's no\
    \ way to generalize, except by assumption/compassion.\n\n> What are your thoughts\
    \ on matter? And on mind? How do you relate the mind and ideas/beliefs to your\
    \ conception of language?\n\nNo idea. Matter is very mysterious. But basically\
    \ my perspective can be summed up as the mystery of the 9. 9 represents the cosmic\
    \ possibility matrix and multiverse, the collective unconscious and the prima\
    \ materia, the matrix of all manifestation and the Great Mother archetype. It\
    \ is both mind and matter and it is a single point that is infinite and everywhere\
    \ and extended into all possibility until it is everything\u2014a completely articulated\
    \ nucleus.\n\nQuantum foam boils and collapses into specificity as it is engaged\
    \ by humans (and other life/particles) with specific karmonucleic payloads. The\
    \ karma or trauma-seed (8) is both the coordinates and the gap in experience.\
    \ Without the wheel of suffering the universe would literally end, because nothing\
    \ would be holding it inflated.\n\nThe mind may or may not be a thing. But it\
    \ seems to act just like we would expect it would.\n\nLanguage is very complex.\
    \ I study neuroscience and have some idea of how one could build a language processor\
    \ in neural networks. It's a crazy level of complexity just to do the most basic\
    \ things\u2014this is why AI is so hard. But nature is just teeming with this\
    \ kind of complexity, and almost anything can be considered a language.\n\nSo\
    \ much I could say about language. One relevant thing here is the idea of YHVH\
    \ and the ego. Basically YHVH is the sadistic/mad/blind/idiot demiurge of gnosticism\
    \ who is the world but blindly ignores the fact, and Elohim/Sophia is the god\
    \ which blew upon the waters to give them life. Yehovah is basically a war god\
    \ gone mad, and he is made out of language, particularly its virulence (language\
    \ became the dominant predator).\n\nLanguage can activate arbitrary sets of neurons\
    \ (calling functions).\n\n> Do you believe in awareness/consciousness/cognition/will\
    \ as metaphysically relevant to your inner world, or the inner worlds of others?\
    \ Or is it delusional to think of yourself as an independent subject when you\
    \ are instead a determined material object? Do you believe you can make free choices,\
    \ or do you consider yourself and others as strictly mash-ups of biological and\
    \ social forces? Are you determined or free? Why do you believe what you believe?\n\
    \nBoth, neither, I don't know.\n\n> What is the basis for your beliefs about the\
    \ nature of the mind? And how does that relate to the ideas of the spectacle and\
    \ sorcery, and your ideas of capitalism and schizophrenia?\n\nPragmatics of believing\
    \ it. What effects does holding this belief have? I keep a seperate list of facts\
    \ in a filing cabinet somewhere.\n\nThe spectacle attempts to manipulate belief,\
    \ because belief is a security mechanism of the mind. If you believe you need\
    \ to use mouthwash to get a second date, you will buy mouthwash. Be-lief suggests\
    \ a stone (lith), a solid thing or perhaps something underneath or gounded by\
    \ a stone (beneath). (This method of comparing words by their roots is called\
    \ paregmenon, and juxtaposing them by their sounds is phonomorphemics.) The spectacle\
    \ can be seen as a manifestation of YHVH (the cold, cruel, evil, necessary part\
    \ of reality) but it also exists as a perfectly mundane material version on earth\
    \ which can be affected through mundane channels.\n\n> Is reality malleable, in\
    \ your mind? Do you think reality is objective, or do your beliefs influence or\
    \ define reality?\n\nNo idea\n\nThat is, no idea if you are talking about \"actuality\"\
    \ which I have no way of verifying (i.e., What is the world? Is it the same as\
    \ it was a moment ago, or a different world? No way to tell if things are \"actual\"\
    \ or merely experienced. Like asking \"is matter real?\" Nonsense question, of\
    \ course its real can't you feel this \\**punch*\\*.). But for me reality is what\
    \ we experience, its our subjective sphere. No other data exists from this point\
    \ of vie, therefore it is easy to see how our beliefs affect our reality through\
    \ filtering and confirmation bias. Those are minimalist explanations\u2014depending\
    \ on which facts you acknowledge in different epistemologies, things can get very\
    \ interesting."

      but now i go back and it seems alright


      9s seem indicative of resolving principles of alternative determinations. between
      definite and distinct there would be a mutual subjectivity, the finite capacities
      of one having the potential to be raised in correspondence to or conflict with
      the infinite capacities of the other (9 being one of these subject''s geometries,
      the other 3). so their subject-object situation would be non-transitive (in
      a transitive condition, two subjective grounds would independently emerge with
      mutual stakes as subjects). in these reflective states that consider the realm
      between finite and infinite, the aim is always to generalize from something
      undifferentiated to a pattern by showing the coincidence of determinations with
      their various, either conceptual or actual, possibilities, and raise them from
      mere coincidence, past higher forms of coincidence involved in particular distinctions
      or set definitions, to a process-historical resolution in which principles abstracted
      upon its basis can justify their powers as mutual independent causes. it is
      only when a particular subject is compelled towards a higher sense of subjectivity
      itself that this reflective state is acted upon, the finite is directly transposed
      upon the infinite or vice versa, and its imitations folded into the normative
      objective mold of adverbial aesthetics of phenomenological method that have
      been as much the requisite for scientific and artistic development as the implication
      of necessary objective existence of subjects.'

        Advertising/marketing, money.


        > Why is there necessarily a cold, cruel, evil aspect of reality, in your

        Well, this is only one way to paint YHVH. The bible insists he is all-loving
        etc., and it is possible to see this angle as well (when Jesus = YHVH the
        gates open). I don''t think reality necessarily has to be this way, but it
        seems that''s the way it''s set up in our universe, with our physics.


        > Is there a true epistemology/metaphysics or not, in your view?


        I don''t think so. The only "true" epistemology is a meta-epistemology or
        metaphysics, but then we are talking scientific pragmatism and utilitarian
        linguistic modeling again, not truth. However there is an ultimately true
        Path which seems to arise once metaphysics is inaugerated.


        > if there is not a true epistemology/metaphysics, then various frameworks
        will shape your experience in potentially extremely significant ways that
        might be incredibly useful. No framework is right or wrong, only better or
        worse at creating certain effects in experience.


        Yes I basically agree with this. The framework one chooses has an *extreme*
        effect on experience and (experienced) reality.


        > However, if there is a true epistemology/metaphysics, then any attempts
        to tamper with your conceptions of epistemology/metaphysics away from what''s
        ''true'' are dangerous and could lead to hallucinations, delusions, and even
        possibly bodily death if you push your ideas far enough.


        I have experienced these extremes and they seemed true at the time (not delusional/hallucinatory),
        and I still can''t disprove them. My total understanding is that both are
        true (mundane/magical), and there is no way to prove or disprove either one
        against the other, only to walk between those experiences/realities *within
        time* in ways which are always ambiguous (cosmic censorship).'

      \ of a mental key to unlock or control physical boundaries.\n\nWhat is the physical,\
      \ and why do you consider the physical to be real?\n\n> I'd consider awareness\
      \ as \"metaphysically relevant\" in the objective, real world that exists out\
      \ there. I think that there's an objective reality that is beyond you or me\
      \ or any of this \"inner world\" stuff, and that should be the baseline.\n\n\
      What I mean is, are you a physicalist? (i.e. do you believe that all that exists\
      \ is physical matter and physical forces governing matter, as understood by\
      \ modern physics?) If you are, how do you reconcile metaphysical physicalist\
      \ monism with conceptualizing yourself as a mind with consciousness and knowledge,\
      \ etc? To think in these ways is extremely confused from a physicalist POV.\n\
      \n> Free. I am completely free, of course with the understanding that my unlimited\
      \ freedom to do as I wish can have obvious consequences, some of which I don't\
      \ mind suffering. \n\n> I find that people remember very well that if you flip\
      \ your boss off and walk out you get fired, those are the consequences, etc.\
      \ but they tend to forget that doesn't change that it's a possible option you\
      \ can still do if you really want. \n\nAgreed. Do you think you have freedom\
      \ over *all* of your beliefs and desires, at a certain level? Free dominion\
      \ over your own mind?\n\n> Being a male Homo Sapiens, with a set of beliefs\
      \ and values that I think are the best for myself and my species.\n\nSo you\
      \ think you are a physical male human body? How does a body have beliefs and\
      \ values? And why concern yourself with your species, specifically?\n\n> Sometimes\
      \ great things wax and wane. And if you're living during a wane everything seems\
      \ like an apathetic meaningless mess. I think all of our perspectives, our thoughts\
      \ are profoundly influenced by the mental dysfunction of our era.\n\nWould you\
      \ explain your conception of the mental dysfunction of our era? And how that\
      \ shapes our perspectives and thoughts?\n\n> To my understanding, the conception\
      \ of the 'spectacle' exists because the spiritual constructions of groupthink,\
      \ escapism, and mass media have been elevated to such an extreme level in the\
      \ modern age that we're basically all seeing through a thick fog. We're all\
      \ victims of brainwashing, we're all part of a massive campaign to standardize\
      \ and manipulate man for the sake of markets that have taken on sort of a sinister\
      \ will and desire to self-promote and expand, regardless of the consequences.\n\
      \nWould you elaborate on your conceptions of groupthink, escapism, and mass\
      \ media? And would you connect that to your conception of brainwashing, and\
      \ what you think is happening in the world around you?\n\n> The action of seeing\

        \ and I'm a bit surprised that someone cares to ask them.  Even more surprised\
        \ if they get read.\n\nThere's so much I could say about this.  We're experiencing\
        \ the continuous deterioration of the human spirit, brought about as a consequence\
        \ of the way we use technology and the hidden agenda of our manipulators.\
        \  The controlling power of markets and the self serving goals of the people\
        \ at their head are leading us down a self destructive route as a species.\n\
        \nThe emotional factors driving this are greed, lack of empathy, cognitive\
        \ dissonance, and short term thinking.\n\n>And how that shapes our perspectives\
        \ and thoughts... and what you think is happening in the world around you?\n\
        \nTo be able to efficiently manipulate and ruse cruise millions or billions\
        \ or people you need to establish some ground rules.  That's what the elite\
        \ groups are taking us on, a ruse cruise.\n\nThese ground rules are rooted\
        \ in brainwashing.  Brainwashing is everywhere- it's on the television, it's\
        \ in the news. The concept is to make people small, and standardized, and\
        \ \"normal\".  Right thinking. Meaningless.  We're put in a situation where\
        \ we're denied agency- the inherant tangibility and meaning of our lives has\
        \ become obscured in our age, we're in a society where the existing social\
        \ roles are being filled and replaced with nothingness.\n\nI'm not sure too\
        \ much about the Elites and the details of what our world looks like- really,\
        \ this is speculation.  I think they're gaming for their own material wealth\
        \ (swimming pools, private jets, etc) and control. There seem to be different\
        \ individuals, subfactions, or cliques that occasionally compete or have differing\
        \ goals (Chinese Markets versus American Markets, Western Oligarch Interests\
        \ versus Russian Oligarch Interests, Company A versus company B, etc.), I\
        \ believe they all share the unified ideology 'Capitalism', better described\
        \ as 'Indirect Market-based Planetary Control', or 'World Corp.' that has\
        \ achieved near domination of the world following the collapse of the Communist\
        \ ideological powers. I think this resulting structure is organic, exists\
        \ in a way that when links fall apart they just get replaced, and it's quite\
        \ possible that many of the links have rationalized their role or don't know\
        \ the full story.  As satisfying as it would be to see Dr. Evil at the top\
        \ of the pyramid ruling everything, the situation is likely far more complex.\n\
        \nSome of what makes this structure so evil is that by its nature it is destructive,\
        \ limiting, and disrespectful of the nature of mans greatness and the potential\
        \ future of the human race.\n\nEscapism is a control tool. If it weren't for\

Serious questions for each of you as individuals. Do you think you are a subject, a mind? Are you experiencing? Are you believing? Are you intending?

What are your thoughts on matter? And on mind? How do you relate the mind and ideas/beliefs to your conception of language? 

Do you believe in awareness/consciousness/cognition/will as metaphysically relevant to your inner world, or the inner worlds of others? Or is it delusional to think of yourself as an independent subject when you are instead a determined material object? Do you believe you can make free choices, or do you consider yourself and others as strictly mash-ups of biological and social forces? Are you determined or free? Why do you believe what you believe?

What is the basis for your beliefs about the nature of the mind? And how does that relate to the ideas of the spectacle and sorcery, and your ideas of capitalism and schizophrenia?

Is reality malleable, in your mind? Do you think reality is objective, or do your beliefs influence or define reality?

These are questions for each of you as individuals, if you are interested in answering
