    I want to be rich and I want lots of money

    I don''t care about clever I don''t care about funny

    I want loads of clothes and fuckloads of diamonds

    I heard people die while they are trying to find them


    >I''ll take my clothes off and it will be shameless

    Cause everyone knows that''s how you get famous

    I''ll look at the sun and I''ll look in the mirror

    I''m on the right track yeah I''m on to a winner


    >I don''t know what''s right and what''s real anymore

    I don''t know how I''m meant to feel anymore

    When do you think it will all become clear

    And I''ll be taken over by the fear


    >Life''s about film stars and less about mothers

    It''s all about fast cars and cussing each other

    But it doesn''t matter cause I''m packing plastic

    And that''s what makes my life so fuckin'' fantastic


    >And I am a weapon of massive consumption

    And its not my fault it''s how I''m programmed to function

    I''ll look at the sun and I''ll look in the mirror

    I''m on the right track yeah I''m on to a winner


    >I don''t know what''s right and what''s real anymore

    I don''t know how I''m meant to feel anymore

    When do you think it will all become clear

    And I''ll be taken over by the fear


    >Forget about guns and forget ammunition

    Cause I''m killing them all on my own little mission

    Now I''m not a saint but I''m not a sinner

    Now everything is cool as long as I''m getting thinner


    >I don''t know what''s right and what''s real anymore

    I don''t know how I''m meant to feel anymore

    When do you think it will all become clear

    And I''ll be taken over by the fear'
