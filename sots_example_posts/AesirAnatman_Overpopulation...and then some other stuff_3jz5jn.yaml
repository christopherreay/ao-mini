    body: 'PART ONE:


      > Aesir how old are you? 22-23? You seem very idealistic.


      When I was younger, I used to be more idealistic. I thought people were good
      deep down, and the world was fucked up. Later, I realized the world is fucked
      up because people made it this way. I tried to get people to change. I saw the
      problems very young! We just need to live our lives differently everyone! We''re
      accidentally destroying all the animals and ecosystems! We''re accidentally
      causing billions to starve or slave for us! We''re accidentally poisoning the
      oceans! Hurry everybody! See the hole in the boat?! Grab a bucket and some fillant
      and we can patch this thing up. All we''ve got to do is realize what we''re
      responsible for and change our ways!


      You know what happened? Over and over and over and over and over and over again?
      People saw the problem and said ''oh, that sucks. But...my lifestyle''. Or they
      didn''t even acknowledge the problem. People didn''t change when they saw the
      harm they were causing, often even while admitting their guilt in creating this
      mess. Some did change of course, but the overwhelming minority. That''s when
      I realized that this world wasn''t accidentally fucked up when no one was looking.
      They knew the whole time! WTF!?


      People didn''t give a shit about other people or about the world. They cared
      about their own comfort. Fine then. I live in a world where most people around
      me are willing to sacrifice the lives of humans and animals, ecosystems, the
      integrity of the planet as a place for humans to live in the future, etc. in
      order to have a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. That''s when I started hating
      regular people.


      People think they need governments in this world because they refuse to take
      responsibility and govern themselves. People want to feel like victims. It makes
      it easy to justify a life of comfort. But, deeper it''s a result of irresponsibly
      externalizing authority over their own mind. That''s a normal thing for humans
      to do: look to other people to help define their reality. But, people decided
      to get lazy about who they looked to to define their reality. That''s a major
      problem. That''s what you call the spectacle here. It''s not some inhuman agent
      that controls people against their will. People voluntarily conform their minds
      to the mass media and live like ''ordinary members of society'', because status
      and property are more important to them than the welfare of other beings and
      ecosystems and the world.


      Well, if basically everyone around me has conformed their mind to this hell,
      I refuse to conform my mind to their reality. I''m going to stop this right
      here and now for myself. I''m re-taking control of my mind. I get to make the
      rules for my reality now. Not anyone else. Maybe I''ll have some reality-sharing
      with some cool people here and there, but I won''t get too invested in that
      anymore on Earth. I plan to avoid hell rather than get dragged into it. I''ll
      go find some better group of beings to live with in another reality. Or maybe
      I''ll go live alone for a long time in my own personal reality. It doesn''t
      matter where I go. The point is, I''m leaving this hell; I don''t want to participate
      in a collective reality when the collective decided to effectively make it an
      authoritarian reality.


      > I am a parent and I am gleaning from other posts that perhaps you have said
      some things about children?

      > I love my kids they are amazing. My wife is currently a public school teacher.
      She teaches art. But we want to take our kids out of public school before they
      are too indoctrinated into the whole docility to anonymous autonomous hierarchical
      bureaucratic authority thing.


      I hope you''re sincere about this. I think your kids are going to be disappointed
      later in life than most, unfortunately. Most kids get their hopes crushed at
      4 or 5 when they stop being coddled and have to go to public school. Even if
      you get them out of school, when they turn 18 they''re going to have to face
      the facts of modern-day Earth: get employed and obey someone with wealth, or
      be dirt poor and possibly starve. There are rare exceptions, but in general
      this is the reality they''ll face when they become adults. And there''s nowhere
      for them to go to start a new life or community with any resources outside the
      power system. This civilization is basically everywhere now. If you let them
      relax and have a good time in your house until they''re adults, then when they
      get to the ''real world'' outside your shelter they''re going to have some hard
      lessons to learn. The alternative is to do what most parents do: teach them
      those lessons yourself. That''s not a fun thing to do, especially if you''re
      a progressively minded sort of person who wants to see your kids happy. Of course,
      you can try to explain the lessons to them without harshly teaching them about
      the nature of obedience and submissiveness to authority. But, those words are
      hollow until they get fired from their job for being disrespectful. That''s
      when they''ll understand the nature of this world.


      One thing that might happen instead of them learning to be obedient is they
      might get defiant to the system. They might try to undermine it. That''s not
      bad or anything. But the life of a revolutionary and insurrectionist isn''t
      a fun life. It''s dangerous. They could end up dead. Or in prison. That''s what
      happens to a lot of people who get serious about defiance and refusing to be
      submissive. They die or are put in cages. Or, if they''re a little less defiant,
      then they''ll just be homeless vagabonds who won''t get a job. That''s basically
      where I''m at in life. I had submissiveness pressed into me when I was young.
      But, I shook that shit off within months of being at university. Gradually over
      the years, I''ve regained my sense of dignity and defiance. I refuse to be a
      slave to this system. As a result, I''m going to have to make some tough decisions
      during the next phase of my life. Because I have literally no good options within
      this civilization. Neither do you, neither will your children, and neither does
      anyone else.'

      \nI don't agree with this at all. Power is a means, not an end in itself. Power,\

          Guess what? Those don''t exist! At best, the world is made of gauge fields
          and fermionic fields (according to the Standard Model at least, which is
          supposedly physicist''s current best understanding).


          Materialism is a subset of Realism (the philosophical view that an objective
          reality exists independent of any sources of subjectivity);

          there is [strong experimental evidence against both local- and macro- realism](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.1679.pdf),
          see also [\[1\]](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0034-4885/71/2/022001/meta;jsessionid=A6AB096232F5486F781F18CBE2C74CD6.c1).


          In other words, Materialism is not "proven" (as far as physicists and philosophers
          are concerned,  such as Nobel Prize in Physics winner Brian Josephson).

      I posted nothing different in style or form than what many other people regularly
      post here. What I said is unpopular with the shared ideas of this community,
      which is why you see the reaction you see.


      People are always free to react to an opinion however they want. They can debate
      that opinion. Agree with it. Ridicule it. Praise it. In doing those things,
      they are asserting their own subjective beliefs and ideas and choosing to participate
      and looking for participation.


      I think I presented my ideas fine. If there''s a problem with the way I presented
      my ideas that you don''t like, just say what that problem is straight-forwardly
      and clearly. Your writing here is very opaque and overly complicated.'

              You can't *not* hold expectations. However, you can expect everything\
              \ equally and have neutral preferences. That's a good way to stay wherever\
              \ it is you're at right now and never go anywhere else. If you like\
              \ where you're at and want to relax there, go ahead. Complacency is\
              \ an option. It's not my choice, but it may be your choice.\n\n> The\
              \ ebb and flow encompasses ALL things.\n\nThat includes the ebb and\
              \ flow of your expectations. You will change and vary your expectations\
              \ over time according to your intent. Your intent is part of the flow\
              \ of the all. In fact, it is indistinct from the all. Your intent is\
              \ the flow of the all. Both doing and not doing are both always part\
              \ of the flow of all. There's nothing you can do or not do to be part\
              \ of the flow of the all.\n\n> It's nothing personal, chum.\n\nCalling\
              \ someone delusional, immature, weak, petulant, child. All of these\
              \ are 100% personal, scumbag.\n\n> You speak of humans as some foreign\
              \ object, as if you aren't one yourself.\n\nI'm not. Being human is\
              \ a state of mind. I am rejecting that state of mind, because humans\
              \ are no longer worthy of being a part of, in my view.\n\n> It's sad\
              \ because you should know that you also have a role in the creation\
              \ of what we all experience.\n\nI don't just have a role. I'm 100% responsible\
              \ for my reality, because I'm willfully participating in a collective\
              \ shared reality.\n\n> Instead of offering anything of value, you criticise,\
              \ as if you're some high and mighty spiritual figure.\n\nCriticism is\
              \ something of value. And my view is that there is nothing to be done.\
              \ And even if there were something to be done I'm still not interested\
              \ in rebuilding humanity. Not right now. Right now I want to stop humaning\
              \ around. I'm consciously fracturing my human state of mind. I'm expressing\
              \ my self and my view here - not to help you rebuild your human project.\
              \ Just to express myself as an individual and to share some ideas and\
              \ thoughts with others.\n\n> You came here for a reason, if you don't\
              \ like things here, contribute positive results and be the change you\
              \ want , or get out.\n\nI'm on my way out, duh. Didn't you even read\
              \ my post?\n\n> There are way too many people with your attitude that\
              \ only make it worse for everyone else, which is exactly why we face\
              \ so many problems. \n\nI'm not making anything worse for anyone - at\
              \ least mostly. I'm probably one of the most ethical person I've met\
              \ in my entire life, though I don't know how much longer that will last\
              \ - I losing hope in humans, which means I might lose interest in being\
              \ ethical. Presently, I take responsibility for my human lifestyle and\
              \ the impact it has on other sentient beings. Other people refuse to\
              \ take responsibility for their contributions to this collective hell.\
              \ That's why this world will keep getting worse. People won't own up\
              \ and change their lifestyles. Too much cozy comfort, and too much apathy\
              \ instead of empathy.\n\n> It's easier to envision yourself as some\
              \ super advanced God and running away than it is to picture yourself\
              \ fixing the problems we face here as a humans, and fixing the problems\
              \ you face yourself.\n\nI know the solutions to the human problems.\
              \ I tried to help the world once upon a time. Humans weren't interested\
              \ in the obvious solutions. They're too interested in their own lives\
              \ and comforts. 7 billion people would have to choose virtue over vice\
              \ very very quickly.\n\nWhen I realized I didn't have to stay here,\
              \ my interest in fixing the problem shrank a lot. If people here won't\
              \ change, then I'll just leave and go somewhere else. I'm not responsible\
              \ for other people and their realities. I'm responsible for mine. Then\
              \ I started to realize that I wouldn't want to remain human for long,\
              \ even in ideal human circumstances. This world isn't that great even\
              \ in the best of times, imo."

                  \ zummi's comment would be a good place to start. I lost interest\
                  \ in conventional life pretty young because I hated the evils I\

                  \ deep down. But we all practiced self-forgetfulness in order to\

        also barely at all relevant to most of what is posted in here. No disrespect,
        I just can't see what you wanted in posting this, particularly if you 'saw
        it coming'.

              \ of all, this is factually incorrect. From toothaches to ALS, boredom\

              \ Politics. economics, religion, stereotypes, ecological problems. Etc.\
              \ Those are the human woes. They are collective problems, not individual\
              \ problems.\n\n> Second, selfishness and viciousness are not even root\
              \ causes of human action. That you stop digging here is another mode\
              \ of the wrongness of your thesis.\n\nI think people are generally inconsiderate.\
              \ They don't consider the consequences of their actions on others. And\
              \ they don't consider them because they almost don't care at all. If\
              \ people cared about others more, the would wouldn't have become so\
              \ selfish in the first place. Bad conditions make people worse, but\
              \ they were already shitty to begin with. That's how we got in this\
              \ mess.\n\n>  Please consider that what you perceive to be nuance is\
              \ actually obtuse, lacking both breadth and depth, and that maybe you've\

              \ instead of flatly asserting an individual's arguments are obtuse,\
              \ take issue with the ideas you disagree with. It's clear your habitual\
              \ reaction is to be dismissive and judgmental, and that you changed\
              \ course halfway through, but that change of course still speaks good\

                  \nNo, when I'm talking about the political aspect of overpopulation,\
                  \ I'm talking about this:\n\n> I also came to realize that over-population\
                  \ has huge political implications as well. When humans only take\
                  \ up a small amount of space on the planet, there are abundant free,\
                  \ unused resources available everywhere. If people don't like the\
                  \ existing communities, they can abandon them and go either (a)\
                  \ live in the wild in a tribal, primitive manner, (b) start a small\
                  \ farm on the prairie away from civilization, or (c) start new and\
                  \ better communities with others. This availability of free resources\
                  \ gives people a choice about whether to participate in existing\
                  \ civilizations, and puts a pressure on civilizations to be fair\
                  \ and equitable and just so that people choose to live in those\
                  \ cities/communities. Such a system would be sustainable if people\
                  \ chose to keep the population low and stable.\n\n> In our world,\
                  \ there are not free resources left. If you want to opt out of the\
                  \ major civilizations, and live an abundant life on your own or\
                  \ start a new sort of life with your friends, there is nowhere to\
                  \ go. All the land is claimed and owned by the governments and their\
                  \ populations. If you want a share of the resources in order not\
                  \ to die, you have to labor for that civilization (whether you think\
                  \ the civilization you are contributing to is ethical or not). And\
                  \ even if you accumulate enough resources to provide for yourself,\
                  \ you still have to contribute to the civilizations in the form\
                  \ of taxes. This is a coercive way of life. There is no choice.\
                  \ You slave for the civilization (i.e. the individuals with power\

                  \ around, giving only enough time on each subject to barely give\
                  \ a broad outline of your opinions.\n\nThe emphasis was the political\
                  \ aspect of overpopulation, as stated above. I gave it plenty of\
                  \ space, and then context, both ideological and personal.\n\n> It\

                  \ It's makes voluntary population control a political matter rather\
                  \ than an ecological matter.\n\n> This transformation of an individual\
                  \ within a group will have ramifications that make sense to speak\
                  \ of in the language of politics.\n\nThe language is: governments\
                  \ and property become less and less necessary the more virtuous\
                  \ people become. Governments exists due to vicious behavior \u2013\
                  \ both on the side of the rulers and the ruled. Politics in a statist\
                  \ sense becomes useless as virtue increases in a culture.\n\n> I\
                  \ also think that the problems resulting from overpopulation are\
                  \ going to be different depending on when/where you are.\n\nI never\
                  \ disagreed. I didn't make any proposals or articulations of problems\
                  \ in specific places, other than about humans overall on planet\
                  \ earth overall. I'm also making a general, abstract claim about\
                  \ the nature of populations and politics.\n\n> I genuinely do not\
                  \ understand what you mean when you say that reality will decohere\
                  \ and the way it's stated feels like that's supposed to compel me\
                  \ to accept some other things you say.\n\nFeel free to ask if you're\
                  \ curious. Otherwise I don't know what you're saying here. Are you\
                  \ telling me not to post things like this in the future? If so,\
                  \ why not? What's the right kind of stuff to post here?\n\n> The\
                  \ tone of your piece was straightforward factpinion. I find the\
                  \ style distasteful and when the loose threads are showing it's\
                  \ very hard to resist pulling on them.\n\nIf you disagree with my\
                  \ view. State your disagreements. We can have a conversation about\
                  \ it. All the rest of this stuff is you dancing around just having\
                  \ a conversation with me about this.\n\n> Incorrect. Individual\
                  \ pet fantasies are not collective cultural fantasies. The lack\
                  \ of communal context in your post and the 'this is what I think'\
                  \ style makes this very un-spectaclely.\n\nEverything everyone posts\
                  \ is always 'this is what I think'. Always. No exceptions. I just\
                  \ state it openly and don't pretend that's not there. Why do you\

                      \ individual complicity.\n\nI totally reject this. Structural\
                      \ violence is a result of masses of people not having individual\
                      \ virtue. By reaping rewards of a society that is based on structural\

                      \ live on it. If everyone benefitting from structural violence\
                      \ personally decided to accept responsibility and refused the\
                      \ rewards of society, then the society that causes the structural\

                      \ 'I don't know' so you keep spiraling out. Further out, there's\

          An Aldabra giant tortoise has a lifespan of up to 250 years; the longest
          human lifespan in recorded history of 122 years belonged to one Jeanne Louis
          Calment. Having children will not cause you to have a 250 year (or greater)
          lifespan, sorry. If you found a way to live for 250 years or more, I''m
          pretty sure you would be on the cover of several science magazines, get
          published in several high impact-factor science journals, and be offered
          multiple full professorships with top universities.


          So, unless you are a world famous professor with multiple chairs at high-end
          universities who has been cited hundreds of thousands of times by other
          scientists, you probably have not found a way to extend people''s lifespans
          into the 200''s of years, let alone immortality.'

selftext: "Over the last year, ecological thinking and environmentalism has become\
  \ more interesting and important to me. It eventually became clear to me that human-overpopulation\
  \ is an immense problem. Obviously, it is unsustainable and destructive. Plus, I\
  \ think there is intrinsic value in allowing other species to have space to thrive\
  \ and form their own communities, habitats, and ecosystems. I think humans should\
  \ have a slice of the pie, but only a slice. I sometimes fantasize about humans\
  \ abandoning entire continents and gradually rewilding much of the planet.\n\nI\
  \ also came to realize that over-population has huge political implications as well.\
  \ When humans only take up a small amount of space on the planet, there are abundant\
  \ free, unused resources available everywhere. If people don't like the existing\
  \ communities, they can abandon them and go either (a) live in the wild in a tribal,\
  \ primitive manner, (b) start a small farm on the prairie away from civilization,\
  \ or (c) start new and better communities with others. This availability of free\
  \ resources gives people a choice about whether to participate in existing civilizations,\
  \ and puts a pressure on civilizations to be fair and equitable and just so that\
  \ people choose to live in those cities/communities. Such a system would be sustainable\
  \ if people chose to keep the population low and stable.\n\nIn our world, there\
  \ are not free resources left. If you want to opt out of the major civilizations,\
  \ and live an abundant life on your own or start a new sort of life with your friends,\
  \ there is nowhere to go. All the land is claimed and owned by the governments and\
  \ their populations. If you want a share of the resources in order not to die, you\
  \ have to labor for that civilization (whether you think the civilization you are\
  \ contributing to is ethical or not). And even if you accumulate enough resources\
  \ to provide for yourself, you still have to contribute to the civilizations in\
  \ the form of taxes. This is a coercive way of life. There is no choice. You slave\
  \ for the civilization (i.e. the individuals with power over the civilization),\
  \ or you die.\n\nThis world has too many people. Far too many people. That much\
  \ is clear. An ethical person would choose not to have children. Not just for the\
  \ sake of the planet. But for the sake of the child. Who would want to be born into\
  \ a world that is racing toward ecological destruction, overpopulation (and the\
  \ subsequent battle for resources), and coercive servitude toward a corrupt civilization\
  \ (or should I say those with the wealth and power in a civilization)? People obviously\
  \ don't think about the welfare of their children or the world when they choose\
  \ to have children.\n\nThe ethical motive for having a child might go something\
  \ like this: \u201CThis world is such a wonderful, beautiful place. There is so\
  \ much beauty and love and light and splendor. So much freedom and opportunity to\
  \ learn and grow. This is such an amazing place. I want someone else to have the\
  \ opportunity to live in a world like this and fulfill their life in the best possible\
  \ way for them.\u201D Obviously, this isn't the reason people have children (except\
  \ maybe some extremely wealthy people?).\n\nSo why do people have children? A number\
  \ of reasons:\n\n(a) They want cheap labor to exploit around the house, on the farm,\
  \ or wherever\n\n(b) They want security in their old age\n\n(c) Accidental pregnancy\n\
  \n(d) They want to contribute a new member (slave) to society - they think it's\
  \ their moral duty\n\n(e) They want a child to live out some fantasy of parenthood\n\

Over the last year, ecological thinking and environmentalism has become more interesting and important to me. It eventually became clear to me that human-overpopulation is an immense problem. Obviously, it is unsustainable and destructive. Plus, I think there is intrinsic value in allowing other species to have space to thrive and form their own communities, habitats, and ecosystems. I think humans should have a slice of the pie, but only a slice. I sometimes fantasize about humans abandoning entire continents and gradually rewilding much of the planet.

I also came to realize that over-population has huge political implications as well. When humans only take up a small amount of space on the planet, there are abundant free, unused resources available everywhere. If people don't like the existing communities, they can abandon them and go either (a) live in the wild in a tribal, primitive manner, (b) start a small farm on the prairie away from civilization, or (c) start new and better communities with others. This availability of free resources gives people a choice about whether to participate in existing civilizations, and puts a pressure on civilizations to be fair and equitable and just so that people choose to live in those cities/communities. Such a system would be sustainable if people chose to keep the population low and stable.

In our world, there are not free resources left. If you want to opt out of the major civilizations, and live an abundant life on your own or start a new sort of life with your friends, there is nowhere to go. All the land is claimed and owned by the governments and their populations. If you want a share of the resources in order not to die, you have to labor for that civilization (whether you think the civilization you are contributing to is ethical or not). And even if you accumulate enough resources to provide for yourself, you still have to contribute to the civilizations in the form of taxes. This is a coercive way of life. There is no choice. You slave for the civilization (i.e. the individuals with power over the civilization), or you die.

This world has too many people. Far too many people. That much is clear. An ethical person would choose not to have children. Not just for the sake of the planet. But for the sake of the child. Who would want to be born into a world that is racing toward ecological destruction, overpopulation (and the subsequent battle for resources), and coercive servitude toward a corrupt civilization (or should I say those with the wealth and power in a civilization)? People obviously don't think about the welfare of their children or the world when they choose to have children.

The ethical motive for having a child might go something like this: “This world is such a wonderful, beautiful place. There is so much beauty and love and light and splendor. So much freedom and opportunity to learn and grow. This is such an amazing place. I want someone else to have the opportunity to live in a world like this and fulfill their life in the best possible way for them.” Obviously, this isn't the reason people have children (except maybe some extremely wealthy people?).

So why do people have children? A number of reasons:

(a) They want cheap labor to exploit around the house, on the farm, or wherever

(b) They want security in their old age

(c) Accidental pregnancy

(d) They want to contribute a new member (slave) to society - they think it's their moral duty

(e) They want a child to live out some fantasy of parenthood

All of these result in negative and controlling modes of parenting. Parents treat their children like objects. Even some of the best parents I've met do this pretty regularly. Children are not viewed as independent beings to be respected with lives and inner worlds. That's because people are selfish, overall.

And that's the central problem with human civilization. That's the cause of all your human woes: human selfishness/viciousness. You will never solve the problems of the human world as long as people are vicious (i.e. not virtuous - virtue meaning compassionate, contemplative, courageous, practice moderation, etc.). And the only way people will change is when they *choose* to change. The world around you ain't gonna get any better, it's just gonna get worse. If people don't change, this reality will fall apart, realities will de-cohere, and humanity as a frame of mind will disintegrate.

That's what I think is going to happen. It's possible for 7 billion people to all turn around and start being virtuous and creating utopia. But, it's very unlikely in my view. I think humans are headed toward catastrophic collapse. Game over.

But, even in ideal circumstances, there are lots of things about the human mode of life I don't like. Humans are weak. Humans are generally unintelligent. Their world is cruel and competitive. There's little to no real magick. Humans think way too concretely for my tastes. etc. etc. For that reason, I'm on my way out of this mode of cognition. Humaning is no fun for me anymore. I'm planning to become a self-realized god eventually, or at the very least to become much, much more powerful. That's seems like more fun for now.
