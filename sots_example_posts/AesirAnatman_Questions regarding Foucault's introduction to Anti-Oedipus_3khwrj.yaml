    \ /r/SotS), the \"terrorists of theory\" (those who appropriate political theory\
    \ for awful ends?), \"political ascetics\" (those who theorize politics but don't\

    \ do. I'm not sure what semiologists do. And I really don't understand why he\
    \ thinks they are bad, or why what they do is similar. And I don't understand\
    \ the reference to the subjugation of 'the multiplicity of desire to the twofold\
    \ law of structure and lack'. What does this mean?\n\nAnswering this question\
    \ is the thesis of the book, I think, so don't worrry too much about it and allow\
    \ the picture to become clear over time as you read.\n\nYou might want to read\
    \ something on semiotics, it might be referenced heavily in that book. I haven't\
    \ read much about it but I think I get it\u2014it's analyzing discourse by breaking\
    \ things down at the \"sign\" level. A sign is made up a signifier (the word)\
    \ and a signified (the thing the word points to). That's about all I know, but\
    \ if you contemplate on those keywords (sign, signified, signifier) you can see\
    \ how it gives rise to a whole world of precise, unidirectional connections which\
    \ can form large networks of definitional dependency. The superificiality of the\
    \ linear, one-to-one signs and their too-perfect networks of signification, I\
    \ think, is what Foucault (and D&G) critique and provide alternatives to. The\
    \ way psychoanalysis is set up (traditionally) depends upon a basically semiotic\
    \ approach to analyzing what the client says\u2014never taking what they say at\
    \ face value, but always using a chain of signs to decode their speech. This anulls\
    \ the client as a person.\n\n> What is the fascism in us all?\n\nMicrofascism,\
    \ or internalized fascism. Google Foucault's term 'governmentality'.\n\n> What\
    \ does he understand power to be, and why does he oppose power?\n\nFoucault has\
    \ a very sophisticated idea of power, and he doesn't oppose power in a blanket\
    \ fashion at all. He prefers strategic engagement in the field of power, if I\
    \ understand him correctly. I encourage to google \"foucault power quotes\" or\
    \ check out Lynn Fendler's excellent book [Michel Foucault](http://smile.amazon.com/Foucault-Bloomsbury-Library-Educational-Thought/dp/1472518810?sa-no-redirect=1)\
    \ which is a a very clear and rational introduction to Foucault (she was my teacher,\
    \ and is one of the preeminent Foucault scholars in the world :-).\n\nOh, and\
    \ he's saying the desiring power subjugates us to power\u2014we put power above\
    \ ourselves, both by desiring (seeking/craving) it, and because it means we seek\
    \ power *over others* and thus the widespread individual craving for power is\
    \ what leads society to a place where everyone has many people with power over\
    \ them. I think?\n\n> fascism\n\nThis word is also part of the central theme of\
    \ Anti-Oedipus, and a simple definition wouldn't do the idea justice. Develop\
    \ your own idea of exactly what they mean as you go along\u2014I'm sure there\
    \ will be plenty of places in the book where fascism is mentioned, redefined,\
    \ or railed against.\n\n> What is unitary and totalizing paranoia, and how is\
    \ it prevalent in ordinary political action?\n\nNormal politics is extremely paranoid.\
    \ Us vs. them, constant crisis\u2014I don't know how to put the connection into\
    \ words, but paranoia is a state of mind\u2014\"state\" of mind. It's a sort of\
    \ fake, surreal virtual reality that comes to replace ordinary reality. I think\
    \ by \"unitary\" paranoia he might be referring to paranoia of groups (us-vs-them),\
    \ and by \"totalizing\" paranoia he might be referring to absolute or rigid logics\
    \ (totalitarianism, probably).\n\n>> Develop action, thought, and desires by proliferation,\
    \ juxtaposition, and disjunction, and not by subdivision and pyramidal hierarchization.\n\
    \n> What is proliferation, juxtaposition and disjunction and how do you develop\
    \ desires out of them? What is subdivision and pyramidal hierarchization and how\
    \ do you develop desires out of them?\n\nNow this I know I can speak to! Foucault\
    \ here seems to be parroting Deleuze & Guattari's recommendations here. Subdivision\
    \ and pyramidal hierarchization is how you prefer to think, Aesir\u2014for example,\
    \ going one-by-one through the introduction in the book and making a list of all\
    \ the ambiguities, and then attacking them one-by-one by asking us about them\u2014\
    very orderly and rational, and your focus is to push away the border of nonunderstanding\
    \ by subdividing what you don't understand and then eliminating those territories\
    \ of nonunderstanding (by converting them into ego-owned categories that you feel\
    \ you understand).\n\nThose three words just mean their dictionary definitions.\
    \ Proliferation means a multiplication, juxtaposition means putting two things\
    \ next to each other, and disjunction means an OR logic where if either are true\
    \ (/right/good/desirable), both are. So applying this to generating desire, proliferation\
    \ means letting your desires proliferate, encouraging them to (e.g., brainstorming\
    \ things you desire/want/crave, letting the list just keep going, trying to think\
    \ up new things you could desire); juxtaposition means breeding your desires with\
    \ each other (\"I want a boat, I want a car, why not a boat with a carport? I\
    \ also want a cat, the cat can go on the boat too!\" and so on); disjunction is\
    \ less clear but perhaps it means saying \"yes yes yes\" or \"why not both?\"\
    \ to your desires (I want to see a friend and I want coffee and I want to do this\
    \ crossword\u2014maybe my friend will want to just sit and do crosswords with\
    \ me!). If you actually do this with your genuine desires you will find they will\
    \ proliferate quickly, and faster as you get going, and that it's a very fun thing\
    \ to just pump up your desire and let yourself enjoy desiring (that's what eroticism\
    \ is).\n\n>> Withdraw allegiance from the old categories of the Negative (law,\
    \ limit, castration, lack, lacuna), which Western thought has so long held sacred\
    \ as a form of power and an access to reality. Prefer what is positive and multiple,\
    \ difference over uniformity, flows over unities, mobile arrangements over systems.\
    \ Believe that what is productive is not sedentary but nomadic.\n\n> Okay, I think\
    \ I understand the 'positive v. negative' thing here. Have positive goals rather\
    \ than negative goals seems to be the implication \u2013 don't be simply opposed\
    \ to something and trying to destroy something. Have something you support and\
    \ are trying to create. (Though, I'd argue there's no distinction between these\
    \ two). Why is creation better than destruction, in this sense, in his mind? And\
    \ what is he saying with difference v. uniformity? And flows v. unities? And mobile\
    \ arrangements v. systems?\n\nHere again, Foucault is parroting D&G's thesis,\
    \ and I would suggest just letting your understanding of what he's saying flower\
    \ throughout your reading. But he's talking about transegoic modes of thinking\
    \ and valuing. Freud defined the instinct based upon a lack, and this pairs perfectly\
    \ with the signifier-signified relationship to create a closed system of reasoning\
    \ (\"I lack X, so I pursue X. If my instinct to get X is frustrated, it comes\
    \ out as neurosis Y.\" All very clean-cut and perfect logic.). Meanwhile, the\
    \ mode of reasoning that D&G and Foucault are promiting is a multiplicitous, multifarious,\
    \ breeding ambiguous complexity which skims surfaces and revels in ambiguous complexities\
    \ (without losing the ability to make accurate judgements or smooth calculations\
    \ on these collectivities of thought). So he's not so much talking about creation\
    \ and destruction as he is talking about two modes of thought, one of which is\
    \ based on limitation (negative feedback loop) and the other which is based on\
    \ runaway proliferation (positive feedback loops).\n\n> Why would you think you\
    \ have to be sad to be a militant? I don't understand this reference? Do militants\
    \ usually have trouble with crying their eyes out or something?\n\nWanting to\
    \ change the world? And also the psychological fact that many people pursue their\
    \ deepest trauma by trying to actualize its opposite in the external world. That\
    \ too is an approach based on limitation/negation. He's critiquing the idea that\
    \ in order to be 'militant' (politically active/productive) one has to want to\
    \ \"change the world\"\u2014see some problem with it or negative thing which makes\
    \ one sad. An alternative would be joyful engagement and artistic creation with\
    \ society.\n\nContinued in next comment.\n\n\n"

    body: '> it''s analyzing discourse by breaking things down at the "sign" level.
      A sign is made up a signifier (the word) and a signified (the thing the word

      Just a clarification here.  The classical understanding of signs is that there
      is both a signifier and a signified, however, there is a more postmodern understanding
      that this relationship isn''t necessarily the case.  A lot of postmodern theorizing
      is about what it means for that not to be the case.  Where signifiers have no
      signified and exist as pure surface and image. Where signs only point to other
      signs that point to signs with nothing real to ground them.  This perspective
      is found a lot in Debord''s work for example.  That''s the foundation of his
      assault on spectacle, really.  "The spectacle is composed of social relationships
      mediated by *images*" The problem is all of those images are rootless.'

        allows that ungrounding to occur. Signifier->signifier->1st signifier again,
        with each signifier acting as the previous one's signified, but without any
        reference to a real object anywhere in the system. Of course it sounds like
        you are referring to further/more postmodern discussions which question even
        the necessity of calling the "next signifier" a "signified" or requiring one
        at all.

    >> And one had to treat sign-systems -- the signifier -- with the greatest respect.


    > I get the reference to Marx and Freud. What is he talking about here? What''s
    the ideology he''s referencing? Structuralism?


    Yeah, semiotics. Particularly the [dyadic form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(semiotics\))
    (see the "Dyadic signs" section there), rooted in Saussure, which comes up a lot
    in 20th-century philosophy and linguistics. Once you''ve read that, search for
    "signifier signified" -- the first few hits look like introductory stuff.


    > What does this mean? What is the ''preservation of the pure order of politics
    and political discourse''?


    OK, so I''m oversimplifying this a lot, but to Foucault *power* is not really
    something a person "has", rather it''s a function of his or her relation to societal
    and social structures.


    For example, Foucault''s (probably most famous) book *Discipline and Punish* is
    about how prison architecture and systems reflect the dynamics of power.


    Let''s say you were a warden in a modern prison -- you would have a significantly
    *privileged* position, relative to the *design* of the prison where you work,
    such that you''d have significant control over certain aspects of certain people''s
    lives (inmates, employees, visiting lawyers, etc.) -- their movements, interactions,
    microeconomy, etc. But your power is also limited by that design. You can''t just
    do whatever you want, you have to wield your control within the system delineated
    by the design of the prison -- the building itself and the flows/interfaces around
    it. If you ignore that, you''d be operating contrary to the system''s design and
    would ultimately compromise your "power", considered in the conventional sense
    as something you *have*.


    As a result, it becomes your "job" and personal interest as a warden to maintain
    the effectiveness of that system, that  infrastructure -- to *police* it. You
    come up with ways to ensure that people aren''t smuggling in contraband, you try
    to defuse ideological struggles among the inmate population, and whatever else.
    And if you *don''t*, again, the structure erodes, and with it the control it affords
    you.


    For Foucault, it is by looking hard at artifacts of society (such as prisons),
    and how they are maintained/policed, that we learn about how power is apportioned
    and understood in that society. To a person who is in an empowered role (the warden
    in the example above), the "the pure order of politics and political discourse"
    is effectively synonymous with the smooth operation of the infrastructure that
    affords control.


    *Edit:* This last point is closely related to the idea that "the individual is
    a product of power". One''s identity -- the conception of the *self* in the first
    place -- is a function of one''s unfolding position relative to infrastructures
    of power and how they must be policed to maintain stability. */Edit*


    I hope that''s not too far off for an intro. It''s been forever since I studied
    MF.


    See also: u/raisondecalcul''s recent sticky recommending against policing discursive
    boundaries. He (we) explicitly isn''t trying to maintain a space where only certain
    kinds of contribution are allowed, affording more power to certain kinds of discussion
    or certain conclusions.


    On some level, it''s an impossible ideal -- but it''s important in radical discourse
    to try to maintain awareness of how power dynamics operate and to allow for their
    flexibility whenever possible.'

  body: "I'll try to answer these questions, but I'm doing it out of order. \n\n>Okay,\
    \ same idea as above. Same question though: What is power? Why not be enamored\
    \ with it?\n\nFoucault gives a nice description of what he considers power [here](http://www.critical-theory.com/read-me-foucault-interview-in-a-sense-i-am-a-moralist/).\
    \ For Foucault \"Power is anything that tends to render immobile and untouchable\
    \ those things that are offered to us as real, as true, as good.\" So, power is\
    \ those things that make the world \"rigid\" or \"striated\". Power is \"bad\"\
    \ (though I'm not sure that 'bad' is the right term to use) for Deleuze because\
    \ it limits the flows of desire. \n\nSo power, for Deleuze, is the suppression\
    \ of unconscious desire which occurs because of the false outer limit of capitalism\
    \ \u2013 Oedipus. For Deleuze, Oedipus suppresses our desire so that we desire\
    \ fascism. I think that this means presenting desire as lack. This is what Oedipus\
    \ does. It presents desire as lack. \n\n>What does 'the individual is a product\
    \ of power' mean?\n\nFor Deleuze the individual only exists because of repression,\
    \ because of the social machine or the socius. For Deleuze, the plane of immanence\
    \ is desiring machines. These molecular machines should not be thought of as individual\
    \ machines, but a single thing (think Spinoza). Individuals are molar aggregates,\
    \ they are things that have been determined through social machines. They are\
    \ not primordial. The individual only exists because of the repression of these\
    \ machines. The socius is a power structure, thus the individual only exists as\
    \ a product of power. \n\nNow, what about the de-individualize part. For Deleuze,\
    \ the individual is not a single entity, but a series of molecular machines. While\
    \ the molar individual might be, say heterosexual, the molecular is homosexual,\
    \ heteosexual, bisexual, transsexual. For Deleuze, the project of schizoanalysis\
    \ is to go through a process of \"becoming\" within the molecular. This idea of\
    \ becoming is really explored in A Thousand Plateaus. But, for AO, the de-individualization\
    \ is a process of deterritorializing the self, and becoming schizophrenic. (deterritorailizing\
    \ the repression of unconscious desire that the socius has placed on the body\
    \ without organs). (I'm sorry if I'm just making things all the more confusing).\
    \ \n\n>Why is creation better than destruction, in this sense, in his mind? And\
    \ what is he saying with difference v. uniformity? And flows v. unities? And mobile\
    \ arrangements v. systems?\n\nI think that, in order to grasp this, one should\
    \ probably understand Deleuze's vocabulary. THe two that make the most sense to\
    \ me are flow v. unity & mobile v. system. A unity/system suggests a rigidness,\
    \ which for Deleuze is always 'bad' and for Foucault is sometimes 'bad'. These\
    \ systems fix desire in rigid ways, which creates alienation of desire and doesn't\
    \ allow the desiring machines to function 'properly'. The flows are more schizophrenic.\
    \ They travel along the desiring machines, along the body without organs and allow\
    \ their desire to flow, and function properly. This is mobility or flow. \n\n\
    > What is subdivision and pyramidal hierarchization and how do you develop desires\
    \ out of them?\n\nThis is actually pretty big from Deleuze, and I think that the\
    \ answer to this is probably what is confusing you the most, and impacting your\
    \ other questions. So, for Deleuze the socius or social machine (there are three\
    \ stages, primitive, despotic and capitalistic) creates hierarchies. In the primitive\
    \ socius these are gift giving economies, that repress desire through cruelty.\
    \ Each member of the tribe's desire is fixed by the rigidness of the tribe. This\
    \ is where 'power' occurs, the BWO or socius or social machine is written along\
    \ the earth. \n\nIn the despotic socius, the hierarchy is more evident. Desire\
    \ is fixed through terror of the despot. The BWO is written on the body of the\
    \ despot (or God). So, desire is repressed because of fear of the despot or god.\
    \ I can only desire xyz, or else the despot will get mad and kill me. So this\
    \ is how, in the despotic socius, desire is repressed through hierarchy. \n\n\
    Capitalism is different though. Capitalism deterritorializes the rigid territories\
    \ of the despot. In doing this, capitalism awakens the deterritorialization of\
    \ all flows (schizophrenia). But what capitalism does is is recodes everything,\
    \ axiomizes everything, and puts Oedipus up as an outer limit so that desire will\
    \ continue, so that people will desire the social machine, or socius of capitalism.\
    \ Oedipus presents the familial as the heart of desire. That everything comes\
    \ out of the familial, all is explained by the familial. Oedipus is able to shape\
    \ desire as lack. There is still a despot there (through religion, or patriotism,\
    \ or something), which creates hierarchies that shape how we think. But at the\
    \ same time, there is no hierarchy because everything is reduced to money through\
    \ commodification. \n\nI don't know if this helped or confused you more. Likely\
    \ the latter. If you really want to understand these concepts, I would recommend\
    \ reading [Eugene Holland's Anti-Oedipus](http://www.amazon.com/Deleuze-Guattaris-Anti-Oedipus-Introduction-Schizoanalysis/dp/0415113199/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1441991985&sr=8-6&keywords=anti-oedipus)\
    \ which is available on library genesis, if you don't want to buy it/pick it up\
    \ at a library. Then I would read Anti-Oedipus itself. It's a really interesting\
    \ book. the Holland book will help you understand the vocabulary better, but the\
    \ book itself is just masterful. "

    \ respect.\nI get the reference to Marx and Freud. What is he talking about here?\
    \ What's the ideology he's referencing? Structuralism?\n\nWell post-Structuralism\
    \ is based on a deep epistemological and ontological shift from the signified\
    \ to the signifier. This puts meaning \"in motion\" but in a critical way. Derridas\
    \ concept of the \"trace\" might help to understand this a bit but the gist is\
    \ that structural is is based on the idea that meaning is only derived in context.\
    \ A word only means what it means *at that moment* because it was used in between\
    \ Stalin and Hitler as opposed to Jesus and Peter or whatever.\n\nThis notion\
    \ is basically derived from Claude Levi Strauss' study of primitive cultures I\
    \ forget which book but he came up with this concept that just kind of swept academia.\
    \ This is French anthropology by the way. The ooey gooey cool weird granddaddy\
    \ of anthropology as we know it basically. As a quick aside, what were all these\
    \ anthropologists studying? Sorcery.\n\nAnyways Strauss introduces this idea and\
    \ it becomes a total intellectual sensation and I am blanking on the seminal root\
    \ here but Strausses work which was heavily influenced by Sassures then revolutionary\
    \ linguistic philosophy- was short lived and most of it is largely discredited\
    \ now in both philosophy and linguistics but it's bastard offspring- post-structuralism\
    \ is very much alive and well. \n\nPost structuralisms summation is that context\
    \ defines a word meaning and that absence or the void is the root or source of\
    \ \"meaning\".\n\nIf the word is not \"present\" I.e. Active, being spoken, engaged\
    \ in the text at that moment then the word doesn't really have any telos or ground\
    \ it's just waiting to be couched in between other words to come alive at that\
    \ moment, this whole idea is dripping in \"novelty\" btw. \n\nSo this idea of\
    \ presence and absence and trace and differend etc is what pushed meaning from\
    \ signified to signifier.\n\nThis is basically hermeneutics. The idea that there\
    \ is hidden or undisclosed higher order or chthonic meaning to a \"banal\" sentence\
    \ or whatever.\n\nFreuds work signals the reentry into this realm of context and\
    \ subliminality. Liminal means threshold or periphery so sub that means just beyond-\
    \ the \"unconscious\"."

  body: ">...and Marx seems to represent a collective/political approach to individual\
    \ desire and expression. Is this the connection Foucault is referencing, or is\
    \ it something else? And how does the idea of sign-systems fit in here?\n\nThe\
    \ reason why Marx is endlessly philosophically interesting to Foucault and Derrida\
    \ and Deleuze etc is not simply \"because communism\" but because Marx truly was\
    \ the first (along with William Blake) to just basically say \"industrialism is\
    \ completely fucked up and we are making a mistake\". In Marx this idea of the\
    \ shift from signified to signifier is latent yet simultaneously pungent. Marx\
    \ didn't really have a conceptual model for a \"self\" so exchange the idea of\
    \ \"self\" for the idea of \"words\" in structuralism and you have your heavy\
    \ petting between the two.\n\nMarx also pointed out that in both the worker and\
    \ the commodity, there was present both *process and thing*. This is perhaps why\
    \ Marx did not focus on the \"self\"'or \"soul\" because it was such a ubiquitous\
    \ assumption that he wanted to focus on process. Process process process. Everything\
    \ that is solid melts into air. Marx was, along with Darwin *THE FIRST* thinker\
    \ to step outside of religious and theological and cosmological constraints in\
    \ a major way and get people to take materialism/atheism/evolution seriously.\
    \ It's anti-religious from stsrt to finish. Another major attraction point.\n\n\
    Of course I have made many correlations between Marx's thought and neoplatonism\
    \ and especially theurgy. Cyril Smith wrote a few essays in regards to a somewhat\
    \ similar idea. One essay is \"Marx Hegel the enlightenment and magic\".\n\nHere\
    \ is what I find the most interesting about structuralism and this atheistic/materialistic\
    \ quasi-non-idealism, *it is a total inversion of renaissance magical correspondence*.\
    \ Analogy was the big dialectical super connector since fucking Plato basically.\
    \ Everything is related to everything else via some overlapping partial essence\
    \ each shares- the vesica Pisces of the Venn diagram. The whole movement of language\
    \ was focused on the *signifed* Because it-the signified-had something *presentable*,\
    \ obvious, in common with other \"things\", ideas, eidos, eidolon, image, picture,\
    \ gesture, something visible, obvious, surface.\n\nThus analogy and correspondence\
    \ is largely a \"flat ontology\" or perhaps horizontal ontology. It is surface,\
    \ rhizomatic, circularish, irrational, tangential.\n\nStructuralism was a kind\
    \ of loosening but continuation of this. Structuralism actually partially sublimated\
    \ this correspondence notion. It basically said \"yeah analogy is at play but\
    \ we can't know what the master key is for this culture because it's not ours\"\
    . Post-structuralism which Derrida actually coined and guerilla-presented at a\
    \ conference that was supposed to basically, iirc, exalt Claude Levi Strauss and\
    \ Derrida was supposed to be one of the main speakers and he gets up to the podium\
    \ and nopes the nope on Strauss and everyone was like wtf and Strauss was like\
    \ Dafuq? And Derrida was all ?idgaf...\n\nSo post-structuralism signals- with\
    \ a push from Freud a return to sublimation, solve et coagula, dissolving fixed\
    \ ideas and \"structures\" into the Freudian unconscious abyss. Again this is\
    \ really kind of the essence of hermeneutics (contra analogy/correspondence) too.\
    \ Because there is a deep sense of paranoia involved in hermeneutics which was\
    \ largely a Jewish affair initially via the Talmud, and this paranoia is also\
    \ a key ingredient of \"the self\". Hermeneutics is one part skepticism one part\
    \ paranoia and one part manic genius. Hermeneutics says \"yes the text *says*\
    \ see spot run, but what does it *really* say?\" The short of it is that The materialist\
    \ era signaled by the arrival of Darwin then marx, Nietzsche and Freud (the four\
    \ horseman of the subconscious?) *ironically* signals not an entry into some kind\
    \ of multi-millenial secular epoch rather an inflection point at which we begin\
    \ the reversal of civilized culture and begin slowly drip, drip dripping our way\
    \ into a re-entering of the tribal morass. An enantiodromia. The going backwards\
    \ of history. Yrotsih Ni Esrever.\n\nSo the four horseman or their era anyways\
    \ signal not endless secular opulence but in hindsight, an inkling that the myth\
    \ of cyclical time- the Yugas, might be true. \n\nWhy?\n\nBecause while satanism\
    \ may seem the obvious \"opposite\" of the xian religion, the true opposite of\
    \ religion is no religion at all. Plato talks all about this stuff too in the\
    \ Theaetetus and the Statesman when he talks about Atlantis and the \"great year\"\
    \ and how there will be a cold time when the gods fully abandon man etc. This\
    \ is in the Upanishads too. Anyways, Darwin and Marx and especially Freud saw\
    \ this coming but of course they didn't get it from the Talmud or some secret\
    \ Masonic commentary Because they were like fuck all that silly shit.\n\nThe conservative\
    \ worships history, the revolutionary ignores it so this is perhaps *how* these\
    \ \"suicide thinkers\" managed to identify the Yuga motion in spite of their studious\
    \ defiance of \"religion\" and \"tradition\", since they did not feel impelled\
    \ by or beholden to these traditions and instead vehemently allergic to them,\
    \ they were intuitively or \"subconsciously\" (or \"daimonicly\") miraculously\
    \ *stepping outside of these entrenched dogmatic traditions for the first time\
    \ in a way since plato eschewed Homeric culture* into some kind of voidal atemporal\
    \ vacuum of sorts... but that's enough fairy tales for tonight, you kids need\
    \ to get some sleep! You have a big day of cartoons and slinkys and mud pies tomorrow!!"

selftext: "So, /u/RRRRRK made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/3k8t9t/observations_on_the_police_state/)\
  \ recently and it seemed important for me to read this intro by Foucault to understand\
  \ so RRRRRK posted it and I read it. However, Foucault isn't writing for people\
  \ who have limited 20th century academic context. My intellectual/philosophical\
  \ context is largely pre-20th century. So, Foucault is very opaque to me.\n\nSince\
  \ Anti-Oedipus seems to be considered a foundation text here (it's on the sidebar),\
  \ I thought I'd put my questions and confusions about the intro to the whole community.\
  \ Be warned, I'm asking a mountain of questions, and will probably have mountains\
  \ more to your reply. So hopefully someone will take the time to help me out, but\
  \ if not that's cool.\n\nHere you go:\n\n> And one had to treat sign-systems --\
  \ the signifier -- with the greatest respect.\n\nI get the reference to Marx and\
  \ Freud. What is he talking about here? What's the ideology he's referencing? Structuralism?\n\
  \nI also understand a possible connection he might see between Freud and Marx in\
  \ abstract (or at least what I imagine that connection might be). Freud seems to\
  \ represent the idea of a personal approach to individual desire and expression,\
  \ and Marx seems to represent a collective/political approach to individual desire\
  \ and expression. Is this the connection Foucault is referencing, or is it something\
  \ else? And how does the idea of sign-systems fit in here?\n\nNext, the three adversaries.\
  \ I'm not yet sure why these are viewed as adversaries, or even necessarily who\
  \ they are references to:\n\n> The political ascetics, the sad militant, the terrorists\
  \ of theory, those who would preserve the pure order of politics and political discourse.\
  \ Bureaucrats of the revolution and civil servants of Truth.\n\nWhat does this mean?\
  \ What is the 'preservation of the pure order of politics and political discourse'?\
  \ I genuinely don't know what he's talking about? And why is it a bad thing?\n\n\
  > The poor technicians of desire -- psychoanalysts and semiologists of every sign\
  \ and symptom -- who would subjugate the multiplicity of desire to the twofold law\
  \ of structure and lack.\n\nSo, I know what psychoanalysts do. I'm not sure what\
  \ semiologists do. And I really don't understand why he thinks they are bad, or\
  \ why what they do is similar. And I don't understand the reference to the subjugation\
  \ of 'the multiplicity of desire to the twofold law of structure and lack'. What\
  \ does this mean?\n\n> Last but not least, the major enemy, the strategic adversary\
  \ is fascism (whereas Anti-Oedipus' opposition to the others is more of a tactical\
  \ engagement). And not only historical fascism, the fascism of Hitler and Mussolini\
  \ -- which was able to mobilize and use the desire of the masses so effectively\
  \ -- but also the fascism in us all, in our heads and in our everyday behavior,\
  \ the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates\
  \ and exploits us.\n\nWhat is the fascism in us all? What does he understand power\
  \ to be, and why does he oppose power? How does having power for yourself dominate\
  \ and exploit you? I assume he's talking about political power and coercion/subjugation.\
  \ I'd be surprised to hear he was opposed to power in general as in the ability\
  \ to act.\n\n> How does one keep from being fascist, even (especially) when one\

## [t3_3khwrj](https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/3khwrj/questions_regarding_foucaults_introduction_to/)
So, /u/RRRRRK made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/3k8t9t/observations_on_the_police_state/) recently and it seemed important for me to read this intro by Foucault to understand so RRRRRK posted it and I read it. However, Foucault isn't writing for people who have limited 20th century academic context. My intellectual/philosophical context is largely pre-20th century. So, Foucault is very opaque to me.

Since Anti-Oedipus seems to be considered a foundation text here (it's on the sidebar), I thought I'd put my questions and confusions about the intro to the whole community. Be warned, I'm asking a mountain of questions, and will probably have mountains more to your reply. So hopefully someone will take the time to help me out, but if not that's cool.

Here you go:

> And one had to treat sign-systems -- the signifier -- with the greatest respect.

I get the reference to Marx and Freud. What is he talking about here? What's the ideology he's referencing? Structuralism?

I also understand a possible connection he might see between Freud and Marx in abstract (or at least what I imagine that connection might be). Freud seems to represent the idea of a personal approach to individual desire and expression, and Marx seems to represent a collective/political approach to individual desire and expression. Is this the connection Foucault is referencing, or is it something else? And how does the idea of sign-systems fit in here?

Next, the three adversaries. I'm not yet sure why these are viewed as adversaries, or even necessarily who they are references to:

> The political ascetics, the sad militant, the terrorists of theory, those who would preserve the pure order of politics and political discourse. Bureaucrats of the revolution and civil servants of Truth.

What does this mean? What is the 'preservation of the pure order of politics and political discourse'? I genuinely don't know what he's talking about? And why is it a bad thing?

> The poor technicians of desire -- psychoanalysts and semiologists of every sign and symptom -- who would subjugate the multiplicity of desire to the twofold law of structure and lack.

So, I know what psychoanalysts do. I'm not sure what semiologists do. And I really don't understand why he thinks they are bad, or why what they do is similar. And I don't understand the reference to the subjugation of 'the multiplicity of desire to the twofold law of structure and lack'. What does this mean?

> Last but not least, the major enemy, the strategic adversary is fascism (whereas Anti-Oedipus' opposition to the others is more of a tactical engagement). And not only historical fascism, the fascism of Hitler and Mussolini -- which was able to mobilize and use the desire of the masses so effectively -- but also the fascism in us all, in our heads and in our everyday behavior, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us.

What is the fascism in us all? What does he understand power to be, and why does he oppose power? How does having power for yourself dominate and exploit you? I assume he's talking about political power and coercion/subjugation. I'd be surprised to hear he was opposed to power in general as in the ability to act.

> How does one keep from being fascist, even (especially) when one believes oneself to be a revolutionary militant? How do we rid our speech and our acts, our hearts and our pleasures, of fascism? How do we ferret out the fascism that is ingrained in our behavior?

Again, I want to know what he's talking about by 'fascism'. Obviously not political fascism. Not specifically anyway. More like a 'fascistic motivation'. So what he was talking about above. What is power here. Presumably he's talking about political power, but that's unclear.

> Free political action from all unitary and totalizing paranoia.

What is unitary and totalizing paranoia, and how is it prevalent in ordinary political action?

> Develop action, thought, and desires by proliferation, juxtaposition, and disjunction, and not by subdivision and pyramidal hierarchization.

What is proliferation, juxtaposition and disjunction and how do you develop desires out of them? What is subdivision and pyramidal hierarchization and how do you develop desires out of them?

> Withdraw allegiance from the old categories of the Negative (law, limit, castration, lack, lacuna), which Western thought has so long held sacred as a form of power and an access to reality. Prefer what is positive and multiple, difference over uniformity, flows over unities, mobile arrangements over systems. Believe that what is productive is not sedentary but nomadic.

Okay, I think I understand the 'positive v. negative' thing here. Have positive goals rather than negative goals seems to be the implication – don't be simply opposed to something and trying to destroy something. Have something you support and are trying to create. (Though, I'd argue there's no distinction between these two). Why is creation better than destruction, in this sense, in his mind? And what is he saying with difference v. uniformity? And flows v. unities? And mobile arrangements v. systems?

> Do not think that one has to be sad in order to be militant, even though the thing one is fighting is abominable. It is the connection of desire to reality (and not its retreat into the forms of representation) that possesses revolutionary force.

Why would you think you have to be sad to be a militant? I don't understand this reference? Do militants usually have trouble with crying their eyes out or something?

> Do not use thought to ground a political practice in Truth; nor political action to discredit, as mere speculation, a line of thought. Use political practice as an intensifier of thought, and analysis as a multiplier of the forms and domains for the intervention of political action.

Huh?

> Do not demand of politics that it restore the "rights" of the individual, as philosophy has defined them. The individual is the product of power. What is needed is to "de-individualize" by means of multiplication and displacement, diverse combinations. The group must not be the organic bond uniting hierarchized individuals, but a constant generator of de-individualization.

Why is he against the idea of 'rights' of individuals in political systems? *What does 'the individual is a product of power' mean? I really want to know what this means.* What is de-individualization and how are multiplication and displacement means of de-individualizing? How can groups de-individualize?

> Do not become enamored of power.

Okay, same idea as above. Same question though: What is power? Why not be enamored with it?

Anyway, I hope someone takes the time to explain some if the language in this text.
