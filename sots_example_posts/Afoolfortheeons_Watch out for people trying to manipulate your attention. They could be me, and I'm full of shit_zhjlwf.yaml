  body: Do I remember you? No. I haven't even met you. Do I remember your earlier
    posts? No, they were white noise, at least to me as they were un-memorable. You
    do seem to be fascinated with yourself though, so thank you for recreating the
    experience of gazing at your reflection from a pool of water.

    body: "Like I said, it's been years, and I primarily would hang out at r/ShrugLifeSyndicate.\
      \ I'm fascinated everyday I wake up and I get the joy of living another day\
      \ as me. I'm grateful if anything. See, I went tall instead of wide with my\
      \ talents, so for years people who found moderate success in creative endeavors\
      \ would tell me to diversify my talent and pick up new skills. Instead, I opted\
      \ to double-down as hard as I could on my writing, juggling, marketing, and\
      \ performance arts skills. Seemed pointless at times, but I knew that one day\
      \ I'd accomplish my dream of supporting myself entirely off of my own hard work.\
      \ \n\nThere were several moments where it all felt pointless, that I was a defect\
      \ who would always be a parasite. Now, I'm doing it, and I'm doing it in a way\
      \ that lets me help others. Have you ever have a stranger break down and cry\
      \ and call you a beacon of light and that you were their all time favorite writer\
      \ because I could help her work through some perspective problems? I thought\
      \ I would be happy when that finally happened to me, but it was more of a scared\
      \ shock. How had I risen so high to be worthy of such titles? I haven't even\
      \ released my book yet, ffs. \n\nI'm slowly coming into the realization that\
      \ this is peak human performance and trying to stay humble as I continue to\
      \ grow. Eternally grateful for the CIA knocking out my ego before setting me\
      \ off on this path to where I am today. I might unironically write something\
      \ self-absorbed and mean it, as opposed to what I do now, which is write in\
      \ character to make an interesting piece to read. It gets so boring when you\
      \ have to be serious all the time. Dance between the masks of the ego to always\
      \ be fresh in your voice, that's a trick I learned on my journey. But, I'm rambling\
      \ now. Sorry, I am genuinely manic right now."

    body: "So, several days ago, a squid in my soup gets up and starts talking to\
      \ me about the injustice in the American legal system. I thought this was weird,\
      \ because I decided to eat only half of the acid at first, but I spilled the\
      \ rest on the sleeve of my red, woolen shirt. Just the same, I asked the waiter\
      \ for the check, to which he replied that I had never left my run-down ratty\
      \ apartment that evening; that I had huffed a gallon of jenkum in the wake of\
      \ the twenty-first anniversary that she broke my heart. \n\nIt was only sixth\
      \ grade, but I had a major crush on this girl named Kristen Saddler. Boy was\
      \ she the girl of my dreams, and she knew it, too. Kristen used her power over\
      \ me to get me to steal my dad's old colt .22. It was tragic, I can barely stop\
      \ myself from crying about it telling you about it all these years later. Shot\
      \ herself? Where are you getting that idea? No, Kristen was picking off cockroaches\
      \ that crawled in the air vent when she missed and accidentally toppled her\
      \ great aunt Myriam's ashes. \n\nThen she peed herself, as I failed to mention\
      \ that she had bladder control problems when she got nervous. That was the first\
      \ time a woman kissed me, and it was the last as well because when her dad found\
      \ out about the ashes, Kristen was grounded so hard that she wasn't even allowed\
      \ to attend school in the day time, let alone see my jolly fat ass on all but\
      \ Christmas Day. That's when her mom crossed paths with me in her car, and I\
      \ could tell they had broken Kristen and made her unable to love ever again.\
      \ \n\nI still hold out hopes though, which is why I've carved twenty-one Easter\
      \ Island heads into my thighs over the years. They represent nothing, I just\
      \ thought I would instantly transform into a psychedelic badass if I hit a certain\
      \ threshold of pain. Never did though. But that's my story, not even enough\
      \ to put a kid to sleep with at night. I'm garbage. Trash. Dumpster fire of\
      \ a human being right here. But, at least I have my jenkum. That's all I got\
      \ now...all I have...*weeping*"

  body: 'It was a dark and stormy night, and I was sitting in my cozy little apartment,
    staring out at the rain as it pounded against the windows. I was lost in thought,
    trying to make sense of the strange visions that had been plaguing me for months
    now. I had seen things that no one should have to see, and I couldn''t shake the
    feeling that I was being watched. But then, just as I was about to give up hope,
    I heard a knock at the door. I hesitated for a moment, but then I grabbed my robe
    and made my way to the front entrance. I opened the door to find a strange man
    standing on my porch, wearing a suit that looked like it belonged in the 1950s.


    "Can I help you?" I asked, feeling a surge of fear as I took in his strange appearance.


    "I''m here to help you," he said, his voice low and menacing. "You see, I know
    what''s been happening to you, and I know how to make it stop. But you have to
    trust me, and you have to come with me now." I didn''t know what to do. I was
    terrified of this man, but at the same time, I felt drawn to him. I knew that
    if I stayed here, I would never be safe. So I took a deep breath and stepped out
    into the storm, following the stranger into the darkness.


    As we walked, I couldn''t help but think about all the things that had led me
    to this point. I had always been a loner, but lately, I had been feeling more
    and more isolated. I had started seeing things that weren''t real, and I was starting
    to lose my grip on reality. I had tried to tell my friends and family, but they
    just thought I was crazy.


    But then I met the stranger, and he promised to help me. He took me to a secret
    facility deep in the woods, where he showed me things that I couldn''t even begin
    to understand. He told me that I had been chosen for a special mission, and that
    I was the only one who could save the world from the horrors that were coming.


    I was skeptical at first, but as I learned more, I began to believe him. I learned
    about the strange experiments that were being conducted, and I saw the horrors
    that lurked just beyond the walls of the facility. I knew that I had to stop them,
    no matter the cost.


    So I trained, day and night, honing my skills and mastering the techniques that
    the stranger taught me. I became a weapon, a force to be reckoned with. And when
    the time came, I was ready. I launched a daring raid on the facility, taking out
    the guards and freeing the prisoners. I fought like I had never fought before,
    using all the skills and knowledge that I had acquired. And when the dust had
    settled, the world was safe once more.


    But at what cost? I had lost everything, and I was left alone in a world that
    no longer understood me. I was a hero, but I was also a monster. And as I walked
    into the sunset, I knew that I would always be haunted by the things that I had
    done.


    I see your cha\*\*\*\* skills have grown strong my young warrior have a wonderful
    day.'

selftext: 'So, hey. What''s up? Been a few years. Remember when an acid trip made
  me believe the CIA was training me for a mission and I started plastering links
  to this sub everywhere I could because that was the job of the gatekeeper? Yea,
  funny story, I''ve now graduated from the full six years of love school and actually
  writing propaganda for reals now. Or at least I think I do, and I''m not questioning
  where my money comes from.


  Anyways, I wanted to pop in here from r/ShrugLifeSyndicate and my new sub r/cultofcrazycrackheads
  to open up about something I think will at least appear intellectually stimulating
  to the layman. Or not. Like I said, it''s been years since I last posted here. You
  could all be gay Nazi''s now, not that there''s anything wrong with being gay. Some
  of my best genitals are even gay.


  But, fuck making stupid jokes, did anyone notice that I''ve brazenly gotten away
  with advertising my two home subs in this post? I make conversion funnels as a second
  nature now. If I cared about money, I could hurry up and churn out my book so I
  could sell it like it''s my body. But I don''t care about money. I care about teaching,
  and I''m just crazy enough to do that with a fuckton of dick and poop jokes.


  See, basically as far as networking goes, like attracts like, so by living as my
  exceptionally weird autobiographical character, I will find people on the fringe
  of culture who are real stand up people, with their incest fetishes and whatnot,
  let me tell you. They get learnt with all my awakening propaganda that I shove down
  their throats. Ok, so I haven''t really tried my form of trolling for attention
  with the current iteration of a landing page, but when I did this same thing but
  more fucked up to teach philosophy, spirituality, and mental health to incels, neets,
  and porn addicts a couple of years ago, that project took off splendidly. Looking
  at 100k views per day on any one post I wanted to get read, and there would be people
  that got trapped in the rabbit hole that was my profile who sent me messages thanking
  me for helping them. If I can''t turn that into a sustainable business practice,
  I''ll chop my own nuts off and eat them raw.


  But, you get what I''m getting at here? I went from a worthless man to a woman about
  to form her own nonprofit in seven years. The CIA did that. Go Project MKULTRA!
  I''m a big fan of it at least. I have all this knowledge about how to use Reddit
  to reach as big of an audience as possible, as well as the writing skills that daily
  streams of consciousness have grown in my brain (not to mention the juggling, can''t
  ever forget that ish, now can we?) Anyways, I have all this knowledge about how
  powerful I really am now. I''m an attention wizard! With one click of my mouse,
  I can pull thousands of slumbering eyes to water. Will they drink? I think so, but
  swallowing it is the real problem, just ask my girlfriend. I''m just kidding. No
  one will ever love me.


  And that''s what''s really getting me now. It''s lonely at the peak. I''m not boasting
  like a cocky sonofabitch, either. I''ve climbed up the ladder of professional Redditing
  to the point where I stopped looking at my feed; I mostly just use Reddit to post
  new content now. It''s turned Redditing, which used to be a very social thing for
  me, into a game. Fuck number get bigger; get more people to discover you so you
  can start being their favorite redditor of all time. You wouldn''t believe how many
  people have come out of the woodwork to message me and be my friend. Fuck, I gained
  six followers today just from a shitty advice post where I ousted myself as a weird
  motherfucker in the comment section. I''m past the bend in the knee daddy, I''m
  on fame''s doorstep, which is doing wonders for my crippling messianic desires and
  delusions, just wonders!


  Anyways, what were we saying? Something about marketing being bad and that I literally
  think I work for the CIA, so I''m like the devil n shit. I dunno. I just want to
  raise the vibrations of the garden, and I see a novel way to reach people who don''t
  want to learn, so maybe I deserve a Nobel Peace Prize, but I''m doing it for peanuts
  regardless. Yea! Noble life ftw. And no seriously, this whole post is an ad to my
  subreddits. Can''t be forming a dangerous, evil cult that''s hellbent on taking
  over the government if the leader is completely open and honest at all times. Fun
