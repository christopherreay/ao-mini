  body: "Not sure this is exactly what you're after, but it feels proximate:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byung-Chul_Han\n\
    \n>Han's current work focuses on\_transparency\_as a cultural norm created by\_\
    neoliberal\_market forces, which he understands as the insatiable drive toward\
    \ voluntary disclosure bordering on the pornographic. According to Han, the dictates\
    \ of transparency enforce a totalitarian system of openness at the expense of\
    \ other social values such as shame, secrecy, and trust.[3]...\n\n>Much of Han's\
    \ writing is characterised by an underlying concern with the situation encountered\
    \ by human subjects in the fast-paced, technologically-driven state of\_late capitalism...\n\
    \n>According to Han, driven by the demand to persevere and not to fail, as well\
    \ as by the ambition of efficiency, we become committers and sacrificers at the\
    \ same time and enter a swirl of demarcation, self-exploitation and collapse.\
    \ \"When production is immaterial, everyone already owns the means of production,\
    \ him- or herself. The neoliberal system is no longer a class system in the proper\
    \ sense. It does not consist of classes that display mutual antagonism. This is\
    \ what accounts for the system's stability.\"[6]\n\n>Han argues that subjects\
    \ become self-exploiters: \"Today, everyone is an\_*auto-exploiting labourer in\
    \ his or her own enterprise*.\_People are now master and slave in one. Even class\
    \ struggle has transformed into an\_*inner struggle against oneself.*\"[7]\_The\
    \ individual has become what Han calls \"the achievement-subject\"; the individual\
    \ does not believe they are subjugated \"subjects\" but rather \"projects: Always\
    \ refashioning and reinventing ourselves\" which \"amounts to a form of compulsion\
    \ and constraint\u2014indeed, to a \"more efficient kind of subjectivation and\
    \ subjugation.\""
