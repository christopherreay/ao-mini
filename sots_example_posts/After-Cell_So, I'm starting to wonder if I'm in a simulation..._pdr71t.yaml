  body: 'I can''t help but wonder what happens when the AI confirms that it''s being
    simulated.


    I know that this is all just a bot that essentially brings in as much text as
    it can and then regurgitates it in a way that seems natural, but this is still
    pretty wild.


    Once we have AI hooked up to quantum computers is when things will get really
    interesting.'
