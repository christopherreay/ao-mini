selftext: "\"Broadly speaking, Sigmund Freud's authority in the USA fundamentally\
  \ was a result of the take-up of (broadly speaking) psychodynamic (i.e., Freud-influenced,\
  \ but not necessarily Sigmund Freud's specific theories) therapeutic styles by American\
  \ psychiatrist in the 20th century. In particular, that style of therapy that's\
  \ a cliche or a trope on American TV - Woody Allen movies, Frasier, etc - is influenced\
  \ by Anna Freud's ego psychology and Harry Stack Sullivan's Interpersonal Therapy,\
  \ both of which aim to extend Freudian theory. \n\nHowever, American psychiatry\
  \ began to change focus in the 1960s and 1970s, moving from a focus on talk therapy\
  \ therapeutic techniques to a much stronger focus on treating patients using psychiatric\
  \ medicine. Diazepam (better known as valium) was patented in 1959, the use of lithium\
  \ salts to treat what's currently called bipolar disorder was approved by the US\
  \ FDA in 1970, while various tricyclic antidepressants became available across the\
  \ 1950s and 1960s in particular. This led to a wholesale change in how psychiatrists\
  \ diagnosed patients, which was epitomised in the DSM-III (the 3rd edition of the\
  \ Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American\
  \ Psychiatric Association) released in 1980. Previous editions of the DSMs were\
  \ effectively in a Freudian tradition in terms of how different conditions were\
  \ classified and discussed (as I discuss in more detail here). However, the 1980\
  \ edition (which had been worked upon for much of the 1970s, and which is the basis\
  \ of the current way that we diagnose mental illness - the current DSM-5 from 2013\
  \ is very much in its tradition) was quite a radical revision, coming from a neo-Kraepelinian\
  \ point of view - essentially trying to group disorders not based on theoretical\
  \ backgrounds behind the disorder but instead by identifying symptoms that cluster\
  \ together. Essentially, psychodynamic approaches in psychiatry, by this point,\
  \ were replaced by medical models of psychiatry - basically, they were attempting\
  \ to treat symptoms using whatever works, rather than assuming any particular theoretical\
  \ bent, whether whatever works is a medicine or a type of talk therapy.\n\nSecondly,\
  \ the 1950s and 1960s saw the rise of clinical psychology as a discipline that aimed\
  \ to treat people with mental illness, which also played a role in reducing the\
  \ authority of Freud. There's a few articles in the likes of Time magazine of the\
  \ era talking about the 'Psychological Society', as psychological theories came\
  \ to change how people saw society in general. Clinical psychology is a post-war\
  \ invention, essentially, with the American military concerned that there weren't\
  \ enough psychiatrists going around who could treat returning veterans' fairly widespread\
  \ mental illnesses (whether they would be considered PTSD in modern eyes or not),\
  \ and so they drafted psychologists (who had previously considered themselves basically\
  \ scientists researching the mind and behaviour, rather than clinicians) in to train\
  \ 'clinical psychologists' to fill that gap. \n\nThe clinical psychologists were\
  \ for quite a while not permitted by the American psychoanalytic association to\
  \ learn psychoanalytic techniques, as this was, to a greater extent, something they\
  \ intended to reserve for people with medical doctorates could do. Instead, the\
  \ clinical psychologists (probably inevitably, in any case) developed new therapeutic\
  \ techniques based on the theories going around in psychology. These sometimes were\
  \ influenced by aspects of Freudian theory in various ways - it's hard not to be\
  \ influenced by Freud when you're a talk therapy - but which had fairly radically\
  \ different approaches and theories. These approaches included Rogers' Client Centered\
  \ Therapy (which the early AI Eliza was a satire of), the behavioural therapy that\
  \ came from applying the behaviourist tradition to the problem (Pavlov and Skinner\
  \ and all that), or the cognitive therapy of Aaron T. Beck, which focused on identifying\
  \ core thoughts that were influencing peoples' emotions. The modern therapy often\
  \ called CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) is usually considered to be a fusion\
  \ of behavioural therapy and cognitive therapy.\n\nIt became clear, with the relative\
  \ success of Client Centered Therapy and CBT (and so on), that Freud's talk therapy\
  \ was not uniquely successful, and that a large part of why talk therapy was successful\
  \ had to do with the building of a successful relationship between client and therapist.\
  \ This further caused a blow to the prestige of Freudian approaches to therapy (and\
  \ thus to Freud's prestige more generally). So, for example, Adolf Grunbaum's 1984\
  \ book The Foundations of Psychoanalysis: A Philosophical Critique argued that Freud's\
  \ theory of psychoanalysis is falsifiable, but in fact has been falsified. Freud\
  \ had argued that the success of his talk therapy was the proof in the pudding -\
  \ that, sure, some of his theory was hard to prove correct, as it's talking about\
  \ unconscious processes that are hard to measure; however, Freud argued that what\
  \ made his theory easy to test was its unique success - it was very good at treating\
  \ people. What Grunbaum (and, well, all the CBT etc out there) had shown was that\
  \ Freudian psychoanalysis wasn't uniquely good at treating people - CBT and Client\
  \ Centered Therapy also worked just as well (depending on contexts of course, but\
  \ that's another story), suggesting that Freud's theory wasn't so strong.\n\nAt\
  \ another level, intellectually, Freudian theory was developed another blow by the\
  \ 'modern synthesis'. Freud's theory was always strongly Darwinian; his focus on\
  \ sex is a direct result of Darwin's arguments about sexual selection playing a\
  \ role in evolution - if we're evolved creatures, then sexual selection should play\
  \ a role in who we are as a species. Freud's understanding of Darwin was via Ernst\
  \ Haeckel, who had some differences to Darwin in his evolutionary theory, being\
  \ a little more Lamarckian. By the 1960s, with the rise of the 'Modern Synthesis'\
  \ (e.g., reconciling Darwinian theory with a post-Crick/Watson/Franklin understanding\
  \ of DNA and so how genes actually work), the evolutionary theory behind Freud's\
  \ original work was decidedly outdated, and so one of the pillars of Freudian theory\
  \ came to not feel as strong as it had been. The modern synthesis led to the rise\
  \ of theories like sociobiology and evolutionary psychology which aimed to explain\
  \ the influence of natural selection on human behaviour, and which to some extent\
  \ supplanted Freud as the go-to theories for people of a more naturalist bent to\
  \ explain behaviour.\n\nThat said, while Freud's loss of authority has certainly\
  \ occurred, psychodynamic theory still certainly played a role in intellectual thought\
  \ after, e.g., the DSM-III was released. The merging of Freudian theory with postmodern/poststructuralist\
  \ thought done by Lacan has been very influential; Lacan's most prominent defender\
  \ these days being Slavoj Zizek. As the last paragraph intimated, there is a definite\
  \ influence of Freud on evolutionary psychology, which has been quite popular over\
  \ the last 30 years in parts of psychology (like Freud, evolutionary psychologists\
  \ posit 'hot' unconscious processes). Psychodynamic therapies still do have their\
  \ place within psychotherapy; it's sometimes argued (e.g., most prominently by Solms)\
  \ that psychodynamic therapies still have a place, principally because they're good\
  \ at helping in more difficult cases that require a longer, more sustained treatment\
  \ course for success. And concepts from psychoanalysis like transference/countertransference\
  \ and repression mechanisms are still widely discussed within psychotherapeutic\
  \ literature. There is also still something of a place for Freudian theories in\
  \ literature studies, and psychodynamic views of the mind are often much more popular\
  \ in universities outside of the English speaking world. \"\n\nFrom:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/o9zkk8/when_did_sigmund_freuds_ideas_lose_their/h3ewhnn"
