  body: 'This is scary, I just went on that sub yesterday because it popped into my
    head that it should be a thing.

    But yeah, crazy accurate. Does anyone actually like those Disney shows?'

    body: 'they run the same formula since they basically let go of cartoons in teh
      80s. new crop of blank canvas kids every years so they dont need to change the
      formula: just blast em with a nice  dose of sass and over-acting and boom you
      got em addicted for a few years.'

    body: Well, The big bang theory is the most successful sitcom of all time. Then,
      Disney channel sitcoms are cheaper, writers and talent are all B-listers and
      their target audience is 12-16yo, the worst humans with the worst taste in everything.
      It actually could be even worse.

      body: It usually ran with shitty dubs back home, which made it even worse. A
        five second glimpse of fascination while zapping, quickly flicked past even
        when I was in the target audience. Like alien TV.

        body: What language? Dubbed Disney channel was huge in Brazil, probably still
          is. Remember High School Musical? Only the songs were in English. Honestly,
          the bar for tv shows was raised above total brain-dead mediocrity less than
          20 years ago, HBO being a few years ahead.

            Channel in Scandinavia too.


            We also have a lot of cartoons from Canada. The best children''s TV (at
            least my favorite shows) are locally produced.'
