Around and around this archetypal Narrative precession. It’s cyclical, it's like the moon; the contradiction is resolved and starts anew. But it also grows; The previous conflict seeds a new contradiction, if fertilizers the ground of new modes and production. The cycle has had many variations: the masculine, the feminine, and the other. Gods, demons, and goddesses. The bourgeois, the proletariat, and the Revolution. Conflicts will reduce into a binary, two sides that are unable to gain ground, but through this process/cycle a third variable enters the system: The force to dissolve the contradiction. This doesn’t necessarily mean this conflict is between two historical forces, as an example between masculine and feminine. It could occur between the feminine and the other (The masculine as a variable), or the masculine than the other (The feminine is the variable).
