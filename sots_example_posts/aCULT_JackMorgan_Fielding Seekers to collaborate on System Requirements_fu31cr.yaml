  body: 'A note on what we might call advertising. Of course we are all used to having
    stuff shoved in our face and so advertisers have to become more and more clever.
    But people like you and me just talking to one another are at a disadvantage if
    we do not recognize the trigger minefield that lays between ourselves and others.
    Profit and power motivated advertisements have been in an arms race leaving the
    little guy behind. What we find is that in order to even communicate with one
    another across a medium such as reddit we have to vastly step up our game. Whatever
    our message is, it has to include an envelope which bypasses the trenches, barbed
    wire, APS mines, etc, to open the listener up to the possibility of communication,
    a real untriggered presence.


    The envelope must contain sufficient bridge proteins to successfully intercept
    the narrative of the reader. This is what causes something to connect, such that
    the reader feels that whoever wrote this is on the same page, playing part in
    the same story as the reader, and thus whatever they are talking about may somehow
    be relevant. This is called narrative intersection.


    Aside from that there are so many words which have been completely poisoned and
    thus cause a triggering effect in the reader which causes a complete shutdown
    and rejection of communication. Even a word as simple as "seeker" can do it. And
    I suspect this one word is cause of the early downvotes. Its a similar reaction
    that many people have to the idea of spirituality. It doesn''t matter what it
    is or what people think it is, its simply been associated with so much past pain
    that its instantly avoided.


    I think one of the approaches here which I am going to employ over this weekend
    is to be very explicit, and attempt to paint as clear a picture as possible of
    the elements at play (the parts of the system) so that little is left to this
    kind of mystical uncertainty. Everyone is working on new systems, there are systems
    everywhere, practically everything is part of a system, so what does it mean?
    I think this clarity of model will be very well received in these parts and others.'

    body: 'Agreed. It''s hard, because you have to use words. Well, in a written medium,
      heh. And yes, some words are triggers. Seeker was a word we used way back at
      the beginning. System could equally be triggering. And yet I think those so
      still get at the heart of the intended meaning. Explicit explicitness is certainly
      welcome to cut through it :)


      PS - We can only package the best we know how. Absurdity is my particular goto,
      which is immediately a kind of weeding mechanism. I''ve been told it''s played
      out, tho I don''t think that''s possible. It could be I''m just bad at advertising,
      too.'

selftext: We at r/aCULT have been kicking around for a while now (6 years or so,)
  and we're finally [starting to get seriously into discussion of System Requirements
  for the new System](https://www.reddit.com/r/acult/comments/fpsxhv/system_requirements_here_we_go/).  If
  you are working on a new System already or would like to contribute to design, that
  is essentially what we are doing.  We are a thinktank, perhaps an art project, certainly
  meant to be collaborative.  You can also start at [the Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/acult/wiki/index),
  to get full background on the framing of the project.  Join us? :)
