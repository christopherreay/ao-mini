  body: Turning the thing on its head is not a revolutionary act but just a feeble
    ironic reurgitation, like the rebellious angsty teenage phase of this idea. Get
    this to r/SOTS_performanceart or something, or use it as zen koans to strike the
    mind. Like, guyse, I get the point of the play, but the premise of the whole thing
    is so far over the border of Poe's law that it will turn off anyone coming into
    this sub who has no idea about the spectacle as it just reads as a circlejerk
    from the outside; or even worse, as an attempt to reproduce the popularity of
    people like Sam Hyde.

    body: What we're on about perhaps does not seem revolutionary, but it is. It is
      far from youthful angst, we're not that young. If it is performance art, which
      writing is certainly a kind of art, it is not simply to amuse. And it is not
      merely a continuation of the Spectacle (though everything arguably is.) It reads
      how it reads. The attempt is earnest. We want to reach folks who get where we're
      at right now.

        body: I can say that the two others I'm responding to certainly have a similar
          understanding to ours, yes. We couldn't be more clear on intent. There is
          no obfuscation. There is an envelope for the payload, as there must be.
          This is as much mist as we can clear. Sorry you think it sucks. *shrugs

                  There are blurbs, yes, with links to other things.  It''s already
                  very difficult to get folks to read anything very long (these posts
                  are obviously too long for many.)  I''m not sure what you''re finding
                  fault with in attempting to pull together in an understandable way
                  the various aspects of shared reality that form the foundation for
                  further discussion of any kind.  We have studied philosophy.  We
                  also philosophize.  Performing actual dialectic is often more instructive
                  than simply reading dialectic.  You can read Des Cartes, but have
                  you been on the same journey starting from nothing?  How would you
                  try to translate a worldview to someone?


                  As we''ve said elsewhere, we are aware there are existing systems
                  and organizations going after some or perhaps even all of the same
                  aims.  If it was working so well for everybody, we wouldn''t be
                  where we''re at.  We could go over the whole history of labor unions,
                  but obvious those have also been coopted for power and financial
                  consolidation, like everything.  If you''re in a geopolitical climate
                  where you are provided a real, reliable health system and social
                  safety net, I guess that''s great for you.  There are millions,
                  especially in North America, that do not have this at all.  We have
                  a rough illusion of this with a lot of "buck up and do it yourself"
                  rhetoric that doesn''t cut the mustard when someone''s life can
                  be ruined for years or forever by a large unexpected medical expense.  Where
                  it is extremely expensive or impossible for many to get any health
                  insurance if they don''t work for a corporation, which then ends
                  up making you reliant on that company to be afford a doctor. Where
                  you could pay into a pension system for years and end up getting
                  nothing. Where you can be fired tomorrow for no reason with no recourse
                  beyond endless lawsuits that make lawyers more rich than anyone
                  they supposedly help.  I could go on and on, but yeah, who''s being
                  naive now?'

                    I find it at fault because it reminds me of my philosophical "ideas"
                    when I was 13. All these topics can be seriously studied when
                    you have the educational background for it.

                    They work very well where I live, and they have not been coopted

                    of the state. America is a third world country, seriously.

                    I am very sorry for the state of things in America - but you are

                      can be seriously studied, obviously.  Should we make everyone
                      get a degree in philosophy to just start to have a normal conversation
                      about the nature of reality?  Not realistic.  I do understand
                      serious study and have been through it, if that makes any difference.  I
                      also think anyone can start to have these discussions and in
                      fact do that with folks from all walks of life and backgrounds
                      all the time.  It''s amazing how much common ground there really
                      is, when you don''t put up walls to what people are saying.


                      So again, you''re being privileged, idealistic, and naive in
                      your own right.  Even for a well educated middle class person
                      of some means, it''s nearly impossible to just immigrate to
                      an EU (or any) country.  If you''re super rich, sure.  If you
                      get sponsored by an international company, there you go.  It''s
                      obviously not easy, and even if it was, we''re not moving everyone
                      in America and should not need to.  The country is probably
                      unfixable, you''re not wrong.  So we admit defeat?  Give up?  Accept
                      the fatalistic narrative?  Nah, think we''ll shrug it off and
                      keep shoveling.  There''s work to be done, and this is all part
                      of it.  We will respect people as people now, in our own circles,
                      with everyone we meet.  We''ll connect and lift.  We''ll share
                      ideas and find new modes of cooperation, networks of mutual
                      benefit.  It''s a lovely way to while away the Nothing :)'

                and by the guilds project - not your post - which are explicitly the
                same as unions and basic social state features. There is nothing I
                confuse about your post, and there is nothing I have against your
                post - it is actually a good one in the SOTS context. My confusion
                came about from the tone of Jack's and aCult's post. It is just a
                case of Poe's law, their posts sounded too much like satire to me.
                I still find it bewildering that they claim it is not. I had a really
                strange day, I am sorry that I came off really shitty.

                      doing to what you stated and I will do so as soon as possible.
                      I guess im in a writing mode again. I have the visions youre
                      describing, but it doesn''t have to be such small potatoes.
                      We can become very intentional and very organized about using
                      a scientific method and feedback approach to sharing knowledge
                      and doing things better. I would argue though, more importantly,
                      that we are very much trapped in the spectacle, the matrix,
                      the mind simulation whatever you want to call it, and that its
                      destroying things at all levels, especially at the human relationship
                      level. Again this going back to the point about how to have
                      a relationship between your inner world and the world out there.
                      Remember the problems that I listed. Growing potatoes doesn''t
                      address that but its certainly not a bad thing and its a good
                      example of responsibility


                      edit: and its not just about cybernetics or isomorphic mind
                      mapping, that whole relationship thing is key. even our relationship
                      to our own body. as in, do we enslave ourselves with mind patterns,
                      shame, guilt, specific roles, do we look at our body as something
                      to be used up and exploited as the world so does? there is something
                      very special here in finding that new relationship with the
                      world through the body. this is undescribable part.'

    \ but I am pushing into these spaces, because that is where the ACTUAL battlegrounds\
    \ are. Sitting above them and commenting endlessly on podcasts DOES NOTHING. The\
    \ world is full of things that feel like doing something, and are doing very little\
    \ or nothing at all, or even worse, creating cover for those who would capitalize\
    \ on our powerlessness in times where our two presidential candidates in america\
    \ are somehow Trump & Biden. And that's just the tip of it--the most glaring part.\n\
    \nIf we can't start with \\*something\\* like that-- Isn't it just insane that\

    body: Thanks for the read and reply :)  Agree on all your points there.  And yes,
      it will take real effort by real people and not just typing about it.  I enjoy
      the anonymity to muse and discuss openly and at will, though, as there are serious
      constraints on real-world identity in shared reality.  There are levels of information
      and social filters, all that jazz.  So it's nice to discuss openly on forums
      such as this.  That is the reason for the emphasis in aCULT on being a theoretical
      thinktank to aid in bootstrapping these emerging coherence endeavors.  Then
      real world organizations can form around shared requirements and understandings,
      and there can be healthy evolutionary competition among these nascent system
      animals.

  Hello there, friends.  [*an awkward smile, a twist of the head*]  Well, here we
  are!  [CoryTV launched off with this earnest piece.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/gi3z60/dear_c_s_t_cc_shruglifesyndicate_cc/)  Then,

  I''ll wait for you to read that, if you haven''t already. It''s all part of the
  journey.


  [*Jack looks at his watch and looks off into the distance for a minute.  He shakes

  these not the times we knew would come? What are we to make of ourselves if not
  the very most at this very moment? [*hands waving*]

  Ah, but I got built up too fast there.  You''ll have to forgive us, we''ve been
  in this Strange Loop (tm) for some time now.  And the last couple of go arounds,
  we''ve seen u/papersheepdog and u/CoryTV.  And here Cory is calling out specifically
  to r/ShrugLifeSyndicate, among others, which is also somewhere we like to entwine
  our energy for mutual benefit.  And the things that Cory and Sheepdog are talking
  about, it''s all related to the trip we''ve been on at r/acult for some time now.  In
  fact, very close to the same amount of time Sheepdog has been on to this trip, though
  we didn''t know it until several months ago.  And there Cory was over is his corner
  of the world, on about the same thing.  And as I said, some of us Shruggers at r/ShrugLifeSyndicate
  are on this Modern Messianic wave.  Then r/Echerdex has popped up, and r/LibraryOfBabel,
  of course, and we''re discussing this on r/sorceryofthespectacle with r/C_S_T crosspost.
  And there are others - The Others - some of you, out there right now, on this same
  trip.  And as Sheepdog said, this trip - The Trip - has been going on a long time.  This
  trip''s been on so long, we plum forgot we''re on a trip!


  So what, you say.  None of you are making any sense.  So you/we all ramble on about
  similiar things in our similiar groups with our similar names and similar aims.  Well,
  u/raisondecalcul once wrote something very similar to <paraphrasing>: you will come
  up with your own name for your organization, and this is sort of a right of passage.  He''s
  right, that''s what happened.  Because it happened to him, too.


  None of this is different.  This is all the same.  This has been going on a long
  time.  Something was scattered.  I want to call it the Information.  Or the Light
  (that''s a popular one.)  Or the Truth.  The Word.  It was obscured. Scattered.  It
  has happened before.  It happened again. (Dare we say last at the cross??) It has
  been coming together again.  It has wound it''s way into many narratives, in cultures
  throughout time.  Ancient civilizations.  Simple truths obliterated by lies of progress,
  greed hidden in so much wool.


  Why has this happened? Who is to blame? One of the main purposes of the [r/acult
  Wiki writings](https://www.reddit.com/r/acult/wiki/index) was to say, in a round
  about way, that it doesn''t matter one bit. This isn''t the first time folks have
  tried to say this. A lot of times a god gets blamed, that''s a big one, right? What
  we''re saying, on the aCULT front (a Community of Unaffiliated Liberated Thinkers)
  is simply, right, ok, we get it. Society''s fucked. People are greedy. There are
  massive systems - in fact [System Animals](https://www.reddit.com/r/acult/wiki/SystemAnimals)
  - that exist and we are all a part of.  It can seem like they run your life. (Much
  along the lines of the current Westworld themes.)


  And yet somewhere - in between action and reaction; in between event and spectacle;
  in between light and dark; in every moment to transitional moment - there is a gap.  There
  is a space where - with insight, intention, and practice - one can flex the mental
  muscle to develop the skill of free will.  For Free Will Isn''t Free (tm).  It takes
  Practice.  There are many approaches to find ways to break through, break free,
  and develop this skill.  Ways to manifest. Pick one, work with it, and be open to
  incorporating other approaches or worldviews.


  [*Jack pauses to walk over to a globe.*]


  For in the end, this is about all of us, here on this 3rd rock from the sun, this
  Spaceship Earch, this Terra, this Gaia.  For We are It and It is Us. And the Galaxy
  and the Universe and all of Existence, all wrapped up in this cosmic dance.  Which
  is why I''m going to cast an impossibly large net with this message.  Let''s let
  our freak flags fly together in a weird wind of holy wonder in this wide world of
  possibilities. Let''s bring the Information together to shine the Light against
  the Darkness of Chaos. Not because we will win. I don''t know if we will. Not because
  we''re right.  Because what is right? But because we know in our hearts this is
  the realization of our path in life. However we ended up here, now, to be a part
  of this Energy, we''re on the ride now. And to back away is to abandon our entire
  lives, to shirk something we''ve known to be True for a long time.


  So what do we do now, in this call to action? We communicate, we organize, we build.
  We learn from the past, looking towards the future. We don''t accept inaction. Yet
  we watch for burnout, we are wary of fast gains, we are in for hard work. So much
  as been lost in this long winding narrative. It will take a long time to rebuild.
  We must have heart. We must avoid turning on each other. Avoid turning to despair,
  to grief, to fatalism. Not that anyone is to blame if they do, but that is part
  of who we''re out to help, the desperate. If you can see past yourself, if you can
  build bridges in a world where they are mostly burned, we need you now. We need
  cooperation.  We need collaboration.


  We are working on theory at r/acult, outlines for the new systems.  Please contribute
  where you can.  There is also another general effort around helping people through
  to the point of seeing what we''re getting at here, of coping with their own trauma
  and angst and hangups enough to pierce the veil and see the sun. Then all these
  other places and people reading this, those trying to communicate a vision of Truth,
  let''s discuss in the comments, how do you think your community can contribute to
  the positive energy potential right now?  How can we spread the knowledge and the
  love?


  For our part, we''ll tell you, take heart, be strong. Let go of expectation, of
  attachment. It''s Not Your Fault; There Is No You (tm). Discover your values. Live
  by your values. Anchor yourself in shared experience. Find The Others (from these
  subs, these messages, this Information.) Intentionally cooperate to stave off entropy.
  Be Free. Shine so brightly that nothing can put a shadow on you.


  Let''s go! :D'
