    said, requiring nothing.

    We are now talking about the thing that we were talking about when we started
    talking about that thing back in maybe 1997 or 1993 or 1986 or 1972 or 1969 or
    1963, or some such year.


    We have come to the part where we realize we have come the part where we realize
    we are at the same part where we started to realize.


    This commercial will repeat at random until you realize this commercial is repeating
    at random.

    Enjoy the ride :)'
