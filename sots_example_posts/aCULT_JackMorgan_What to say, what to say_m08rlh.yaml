  body: "Your name is \"Jack\", eh? \n\nWell I just joined this subreddit and I certainly\
    \ DON'T want to participate in some mouthpiece political agenda no matter what\
    \ flavor. The conspiracy theory blame game is also pointless. I live in Washington\
    \ DC and I'm telling you-- the buildings are empty and the last laugh is on you.\n\
    \nOne simple way of seeing past such conditioning is asking yourself: Who do I\
    \ blame for my current reality?... and then realize that whomever you point your\
    \ finger at: there is always three folded fingers pointing back at yourself. And\
    \ if you indeed blame yourself for this reality then bravo-- that is your first\
    \ step towards change. Change yourself.\n\nHowever... if everything is spectacle,\
    \ then nothing is spectacle. We need some neutral point to observe the spectacle\
    \ from. If that is not this sub, then where would we locate the neutral zone?\
    \ \n\nSince we can easily graph higher dimensions than 4 using math and Cartesian\
    \ plotting points, I believe the first step is locating your Higher self, an avatar\
    \ of who you will be in the future once time has played itself out and you know\
    \ the meaning of everything. Crowley called this avatar the \"Bornless One\" aka\
    \ your Holy Guardian Angel. You can summon this being to meet you within your\
    \ dreamscape and seek advice on how you should move forward. \n\nThere have been\
    \ many martyrs but the problem is, death is only temporary and then you face the\
    \ veil of forgetting and find yourself right back where you started. So knowledge\
    \ can replace the human sacrifice as long as we push ourselves relentlessly. You\
    \ are not your body."

  body: Indeed, and as usual, the comment on comment is necessary to prove that one
    is earnest in their crosspost of material relative to this sub.  The Spectacle
    is prominently featured in this post, speaking to its agency-robbing narrative.  Fight
    against this urge.
