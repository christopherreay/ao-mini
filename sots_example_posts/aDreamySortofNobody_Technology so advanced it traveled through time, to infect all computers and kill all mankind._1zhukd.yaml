Don't know if anyone else listens to Insect Warfare but lines like this remind me of Nick Land's writings, technology as a militant force, etc...they seem to be very spectacle-aware. I recently started listening to the album again, I feel like it innoculates me against influence from the constant bombardment  of the Hollywood, military-industrial dream machine.

Other highlights:

    Mass Communication Mindfuck

you see something on cnn or the internet. you think you're in tune with the world but you don't know jack shit. your grasp on reality is abstract, believe all you hear as fact. falling for their hype machine, worshipping your tv screen. everybody's doing it but i don't fucking buy it. you and all your myspace friends should get flushed down the toilet.

and...

    Enslaved By Machinery

science advances to benefit man. opportunists abuse it to take what they can. transformed to a nation of dependence and sloth. a mindless flock incapable of thought. reliant on hand outs, unable to provide for themselves. lethargy. indolence. a heard of sheep, waiting to be led. used to being bottle-fed. fuck the internet, fuck tv, or anything that uses electricity.
