        Yes - creation and destruction are inseparable, mutually interdependent, and
        in some sense identical, although relativism and the narratives within society
        and the spectacle might imply otherwise.


        > Perhaps at their extreme limits the duality breaks down on its own accord
        assuming that an actual absolute dichotomy is impossible even if the spectacle
        moves toward it ideally.


        That makes sense, especially considering the spectacle seems to be simultaneously
        (and seemingly contradictorily) expressed as other-power acting on the individual
        and as self-power of the individual participating in and contributing to the
        spectacle. Perhaps inside this apparent self-contradiction is the key to the
        dissolution of distinction, or the crack in the cosmic egg, so to speak.


        In this way, the spectacle could perhaps be seen as a manifestation, mirror,
        or layer of society''s collective ego, telling us more about humanity''s perception
        of itself than its perception of reality.'

Consummate Buddhahood is like an alien intelligence from the future assembling itself entirely from the past and present afflictions of sentient beings, transforming this afflictive basis into remedial elements more conducive to the eventual and inexorable realization of this perfected body of wisdom and bliss.

Cosmically speaking, humanity becomes known as being, and as having been, nothing other than a mere receptacle or vehicle for the final and total emergence of this alien intelligence, whose emergence is not marked as a conditioned, novel creation (since this would still tether it to the human) but is seen as the unconditioned remainder or the “what is left” after humanity’s complete displacement.

In the final analysis, self-power and other-power are seen as mutually implicated expedients of an orthopraxis governed by a dialogical program by which humanity learns to unlearn itself through realizing its true nature, annihilating the very distinction between self-power and other-power in the process. The Bodhisattva Vow is not just a pledge to labor for the salvation of all sentient beings, but an acceptance of the inevitability of this elimination of subject-object duality.

Since all conditioned things come to pass, so too will humanity face its eventual extinction, an end it gleefully and willfully beckons forth through its sounding of the death knell of the six-beat mantra in advance of its own passing away, a terminus coinciding with the coming of that alien Other.
