  body: 'I read the [blogpost](https://holo-poiesis.com/2020/03/27/notes-on-the-dialectic-of-sex-and-gender/)
    in the linked post, really interesting, clear writing.


    >*"The real basis of alienated suffering or dysphoria is found in the compulsion
    to identify itself, rather than the unease produced from a misplacement of identity.
    The latter, misplacement of identity, is only a symptom of a deeper disease that
    is the former, the compulsion to identify."*


    This basically sums up my view of identity.


    Just one thing, on abstraction,


    >*"..., so that the possibility of a life free of the rule of abstractions becomes
    finally available."*


    while I''m the first to join the fight against harmful abstraction, be it gender,
    value, or any other *''real abstraction''* holding us back, I don''t think that
    an entirely unmediated life, free of all abstraction, is possible. I think we
    will always be "ruled by abstraction" in some sense. Abstracting, categorising,
    equalising, call it what you want, is something we do all the time, it''s an essential
    feature of cognition, it''s the way we deal with the infinite variety of our environment,
    and we wouldn''t survive for long without it. Breaking all these artificial structures
    down is for sure a goal, but not a goal that can ever be fully reached, it can
    only serve as a *horizon*, there to prompt us to search for something better,
    for ways to update our models, there to perpetually make us *change our minds*.'

        chain that ties me to my child self is very real.

        body: 'in a way our social environment is constantly "hailing" us as discrete
          individual subjects, and each distinct way phenomena refer to us as individuals
          articulates us as a certain kind of subject. Someone refers to me as *her*
          son, which reciprocally determines her as *my* mother. Here not only am
          I called out as discrete individual existent but I am also capable of being
          in possession of others in some way or another. Ordinary waking life in
          society consists of an uncountable sequence of these sorts of relationships
          that solidify a sense of inner self-identity over time.


          So I think the problem is one of embodied practice v.s. conceptual understanding.
          We may conceptually understand that we cannot find an inner "I," but we
          are always behaving in the world *as if* there were an I, which entrenches
          in our behavior a false but subtle sense of self that contradicts what we
          know to be true rationally.


          Again the Buddhist tradition is useful here because part of their practice
          is in isolating periods of time and space from ordinary waking life in order
          to familiarize oneself with a mode of experience in which the incessant
          impulse to identify and conceptualize is subdued. The maximal goal would
          be to eliminate (in practice, not thought) the distinction between meditation
          and non-meditation, so that the mode of experience cultivated in meditation
          becomes the general mode of experience throughout waking life. The idea
          is that we will still be able to operate in the conventional world and communicate
          intelligibly with other beings without falling under the spell of language
          and its process of identifying phenomena as discrete individual entities.'

    body: "Thank you for the engagement.\n\nYou have made good points about abstraction,\
      \ which points to an ambivalence in my own thought as to the final nature and\
      \ utility of abstraction. I agree that abstraction is a basic element of human\
      \ cognition and forms an integral part of how we exist in the world. In fact\
      \ I think making use of abstraction is a necessary part of the process of overcoming\
      \ dominating abstractions. The idea that we should be inherently suspicious\
      \ of abstraction and immediately dispose of its use is a primitivist one. Indeed,\
      \ John Zerzan, who on top of being an political primitivist, is an epistemological\
      \ anarchist who is deeply suspicious of symbolic language (and by extension,\
      \ mathematics) and identifies it as an analog to the civilizing domestication\
      \ of wild nature, whereby it domesticates the qualitative richness of our sensory\
      \ experience.\n\nI would rather aim to steer clear of that extreme, as well\
      \ as the opposite extreme of an unconditional accelerationism where an inhuman\
      \ hypercapitalism is allowed to continuously reconfigure the world to be well\
      \ accorded to its abstracting operations. \n\nI guess my issue with abstraction\
      \ is that Zerzan is actually kind of right when he states that these basic features\
      \ or operations of cognition are not universal and are historically contingent,\
      \ and thus amenable to transformation. While it may be difficult to imagine\
      \ a way of being in the world devoid of the process of abstraction, Buddhists\
      \ have been claiming for the last 2,500 years that such a way of being is possible,\
      \ and that it is nothing other than full Buddhahood. Buddhas are not only defined\
      \ by their ability to directly engage reality with a discerning wisdom that\
      \ does not require abstraction, but are also considered to be the final nature\
      \ of all beings, whether they are able to realize this potential or not.\n\n\
      But even if you buy the whole Buddha thing, it is kind extraordinarily difficult\
      \ to achieve such a mode of being. So for us ordinary sentient beings, I think\
      \ the best thing we can do is to delimit the purposes of abstraction from the\
      \ very outset, using them in a way that makes it impossible for us to mistake\
      \ them for reality."

      body: "I think you're right, though, despite my somewhat limited knowledge of\

        \ as a state defined by *conscious abstracting*.\n\nLet me explain, and also\
        \ try my best to give an answer to both of your comments above, but first,\
        \ I'd like to spend a moment to *deanthropomorphise* the concept of abstraction.\
        \ I don't see it as an essentially human thing, I don't even think it's a\
        \ feature exclusive to the animal kingdom, but a much more general feature\
        \ of *life-like systems*. In my frame, which ironically is about as abstract\
        \ as it gets, abstraction is a kind of *reduction*, a way of taking one large\
        \ set of inputs and *mapping* them onto a smaller set of outputs. I\u2019\
        m drawing from abstract mathematics, where this kind of mapping would be called\
        \ a *'non-injective surjective function'*, or a kind of *'epimorphism'*, stemming\
        \ from the Greek words *'epi'* meaning 'onto', *'morphe'* meaning 'shape'\
        \ or 'structure', and the suffix *'-ism'*, turning it all into an action of\
        \ 'making something fit another shape'.\n\nOk, that might seem excessively\
        \ 'mathy', but hear me out, the basic utility of abstraction is to transform\
        \ an intractable problem into a solvable one. Of course, this transformation\
        \ cannot be done without *assumptions*, and the process is in its nature irreversible\
        \ because it's essentially a 'lossy compression' of the problem domain. However,\
        \ the usual way this 'algorithmic transformation' functions in practice, if\
        \ I may use an analogy, means that with *'good assumptions'* you can still\
        \ clearly see the content of an image even after it's been heavily compressed.\
        \ The key takeaway here, is that abstraction itself is a fundamentally neutral\
        \ process, but the assumptions it entails are subjective.\n\nIn one way, even\
        \ our 'primitive' sensory experiences, our *emotions*, are ways of *reducing*\
        \ our environment. We don't perceive the world 'as it is', that wouldn't be\
        \ possible, instead we perceive our environment *through* our emotions. But\
        \ here comes the tricky part: as *faithful bodhisattvas*, we'll need to discover\
        \ the *implicit assumptions*, hidden behind our abstract emotions, and this\
        \ is *not* an easy task.\n\nAs you said, some of this is historically and\
        \ socially contingent, but unfortunately, that doesn't cover the whole story.\
        \ To get a more complete picture, we need to take a brief detour through some\
        \ Evolutionary Biology, and try to find the primal origins of our emotions,\
        \ but before we begin, let's first remind ourselves that these are territories\
        \ best treaded lightly. Many people before us have ventured into these murky\
        \ waters and some of them came back with various vile creatures, found under\
        \ rocks best left unturned.\n\nWith that caveat aside; Basically, our emotions\
        \ are part of the lower levels of our way of processing information, sometimes\
        \ called the *Limbic System*, note that the original conception of the term\
        \ is somewhat dated, all of the information we receive from our environment\
        \ is filtered through this lower level before, and even if, it reaches the\
        \ conscious parts of our minds. The system is even able to put in its veto,\
        \ overriding our conscious minds and affecting our behaviour if it deems that\
        \ the situation demands it. Powerful stuff, eh? Well, this filtering, or *abstracting*,\
        \ is largely determined by *assumptions* encoded in our physiology, not encoded\
        \ in an ahistoric, essentialist, and gene-centric kind of way, but as an interplay\
        \ between different environmental, genetic and *developmental processes*.\n\
        \nMy view, is that there's one such important process, one that's been widely\
        \ studied in the field of Evolutionary Developmental Biology, which plays\
        \ a crucial role when we're talking about everything from abstraction and\
        \ emotions to our conception of self, identity and gender, and I'm glad you've\
        \ already brought it up along with Zerzan; it's called *The Domestication\
        \ Process*.\n\n*Domestication* is an evolutionary process in which a population\
        \ over time evolves to retain a more youthful phenotype into adulthood, something\
        \ called *'neoteny'*. It's been hypothesised that recent human evolution,\
        \ i.e. the last 100 000 years or so, has been dominated by this kind of drive\
        \ towards neoteny, characterised by a decreased propensity for fear and aggression\
        \ and an increased orientation towards the social. With it comes empathy,\
        \ cooperation and an increased capacity for symbolic thought, all features\
        \ that's formed the basis for our eventual development of language.\n\nAnother\
        \ important neotenous trait, to harken back to the topic of your blogpost,\
        \ is a lessened *sexual dimorphism*. It turns out, that a side effect of our\
        \ own domestication has been that the difference between the sexes has been\
        \ greatly reduced, our sexualities have taken on a more ambiguous form, and\
        \ the evolutionary basis for an eventual transcendence of gender, which I'm\
        \ partly hypothesising as an intermediary step in our evolutionary symbolic\
        \ development, has been formed.\n\nIn this framework, where we're turned towards\
        \ each other, where we're becoming more and more *'hardwired'* for empathy\
        \ and cooperation, it's no wonder that our habit of *identifying* is so deeply\
        \ rooted, both in our culture and at our very core. As we further evolve,\
        \ both culturally and biologically, this co-constitutive relationship between\
        \ physiology and representation, where our symbolic thought drives us towards\
        \ cooperation, and our need to cooperate further drives our cognitive capacity,\
        \ may eventually lead us to an entirely different world.\n\nSo, and realise\
        \ this might be the ghost of Hegel talking through me, paradoxically, or should\
        \ I say *dialectically*? It's only by knowing ourselves, in body and mind,\
        \ *through* language, symbols and community that we may eventually transcend\
        \ the tyranny of structure, break down the distinction between meditation\
        \ and non-meditation, understand our own inescapable mediation, and *become\
        \ Buddha*.\n\nFuck, that didn't even make sense, did it?"
