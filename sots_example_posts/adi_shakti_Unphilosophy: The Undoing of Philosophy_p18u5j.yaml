    body: "good question, I'm not quite sure. I'm aware of nonphilosophy but frankly\
      \ don't have the time and energy now to try to break through what I experience\
      \ as an impenetrable wall of jargon and sometimes very difficult to read writing\
      \ style. However I've gathered just enough to recognize that Unphilosophy sounds\
      \ very similar to Nonphilosophy, though my intuition is that nonphilosophy's\
      \ axiomatic assumption that there is some kind of Real that is the object of\
      \ philosophical thought yet somehow always eludes its grasp. Unphilosophy has\
      \ no need for this assumption of a Real that philosophy either gets at or doesn't\
      \ get at. Unphilosophy is purely interested in revealing the faults and inconsistencies\
      \ of philosophical views on the ultimate nature of things, beyond that it has\
      \ absolutely no comment on the presence or absence of some \"Real.\"   \n\n\n\
      So i do vaguely refer to non-philosophy in the text at some point, and give\
      \ some basic suggestions as to how to know whether or not non-philosophy is\
      \ subject to unphilosophical undoing."

    body: "take for example this blurb about Non-philosophy: \"Non-philosophy is not\
      \ the negation of philosophy, but the suspension of philosophy's claim to think\
      \ the real (Principle of Sufficient Philosophy), and it is the invention of\
      \ new usages of thought and language that disrupt the rational narrative of\
      \ the real.\"  \n\n\nI can already say that Unphilosophy *is* the negation of\
      \ philosophy. Also, to feel the need to disrupt philosophy's account of the\
      \ real is to assume from the beginning that there is a real in the first place\
      \ to which philosophy could or could not correspond. I'm probably just repeating\
      \ myself again here, but Unphilosophy is indifferent to such a real. It neither\
      \ contrasts this real to philosophy's image of the real nor does it defend a\
      \ real from philosophical capture, it merely shows that philosophy's claim to\
      \ a real is a hypostatized real of its own fabrication."

    body: haha I am! cool to see you recognized me and you're right that there's a
      Buddhist connection to Unphilosophy though it is important for me not to make
      an explicit connection between the two because one of my prime motivations for
      Unphilosophy was to see how I could translate what I understand to be the nature
      and function of Madhyamaka analysis outside of the Buddhist tradition. I would
      count Nagarjuna's Mulamadhyamakakarikas as a prime example of deploying the
      procedure of unphilosophy, in this case the unphilosophical undoing of Abidharma
      scholastic philosophy.

        body: yeah! I've been interested in stuff like critical theory, new materialism,
          process philosophy etc. before I became a Buddhist, after which point most
          of my time reading and writing has been preoccupied with Buddhism. But I
          have also noticed a lot of resonances between Buddhist insights and the
          insights you find in the aforementioned Western thought. I'm actually planning
          on picking up *A Thousand Plateaus* for the first time in the near future,
          so I hope to discover and draw out parallels between D&G and Buddhism in
          my writing.

  body: 'You want the magic words of unphilosophy?:


    For a proposition to be true, it must be a justified conclusion from true premises.
    But those premises must themselves be true ad infinitum, leaving only three options:


    (a) truth is justified by an infinite regress that is impossible to traverse,
    thus we cannot attain truth


    (b) truth is circularly justified, but any truth can be justified circularly thus
    we cannot attain truth


    (c) there are foundational unjustified truths, but there is no way to identify
    them, thus we cannot attain truth


    Therefore, it is true that we cannot attain truth ;)'

*Excerpt from my* [*essay on Unphilosophy*](https://holo-poiesis.com/2021/08/09/unphilosophy-undoing-philosophy/)*:*  


Philosophy is, from the very outset, internally constituted by a complex dynamic of mutually contradictory interests that guarantees its continued reproduction over time: by ensuring that wisdom is never actually delivered by always functioning outside of its domain, philosophy secures its own tenure by supplying the very conditions for its own apparent necessity. This sort of deceptive dynamic is an ingenious set-up when you’re a morally indifferent capitalist entrepreneur interested in maximizing returns on investment, but quite stupid when considered even on philosophy’s own terms. For these (non-exhaustive) reasons philosophy is boring and useless at best and deluded and deluding at worst.

Thus Unphilosophy is called to duty in order to bring down philosophy from its empyrean pretense to stand on the firmament of universal reason and bring it back down to the embodied and enacted flows of matter-energy-affect. The messianic praxis of Unphilosophy undoes and recycles the royal tapestry of the high estate of philosophy, to be fashioned into goods made with-and-for the humble peasantry of our common land where all that is thought are mere thoughts.

Since the peculiar responsibility of Unphilosophy to undo philosophy necessitates that its substance exists elusively and exclusively as responses to philosophy, Unphilosophy is a momentary and socializing praxis.  In its very being and mode of operation, Unphilosophy teaches us the dialogical nature of the process of illuminating wisdom by demonstrating, out in the open for all to see, the complete folly of the underlying basis, operating function and motivating aim of the imperial state of monological reason aka philosophy, making fully transparent the inability for this state to stand on its own without some kind of robbery of the very life that produces its conditions of existence. By means of the revolutionary movement of wisdom in the service of life, the expropriators are expropriated, and philosophy is unphilosophically undone.
