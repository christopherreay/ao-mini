    They already tried this in Vietnam, it was called Operation Wandering Soul, where
    US psychological warfare teams tried to exploit the Vietnamese belief that if
    a person is not given a proper burial, their soul lingers as a ''wandering soul''.
    They recorded tapes of haunting sounds and voices and played it outside bases,
    trying to scare Viet Cong soldiers into abandoning their positions. This didn''t
    work however, because, from what was reported, the Vietnamese weren''t stupid
    and recognised the sounds as what they were, just tapes being played. It does
    show the regard the US had for the Vietnamese people though...


    [You can listen to one of these tapes here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d9H_1ygEv8)'

  body: The US, China, Russia, and some non-state actors have been engaged in deep
    and increasing cyber warfare for at least a decade.  They are and have been using
    ai weaponry on civilian populations.  The extent of the warfare is immense though
    is somehow largely unknown.  I wonder what will happen once these warcrimes are
    brought to light.

  body: The age of great wars is in the past. There can be small scale conflicts between
    various nations but there is just no incentive to start a global conflict because
    the scale of destruction for all parties involved will be too heavy to be profitable.
    There will only be cold cyber meme warfare in the future unless someone puts a
    J in the deck.
