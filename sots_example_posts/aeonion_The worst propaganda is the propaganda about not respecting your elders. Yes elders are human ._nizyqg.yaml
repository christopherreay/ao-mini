  body: The propaganda is division. Young - old, men - women, black - white, etc,
    creating division and inventing justifications for those divisions is all part
    of the same program. I don't think one is bigger concern than the rest.

  body: 'The trouble is that most arguments of this type are "dual-use".  Yes, the
    point can be made that the elites have advanced knowledge that puts them in a
    position of superiority.  However, it is also true that elites have almost always
    ruthlessly exploited that power differential for their own benefit and tyranically
    opposed any attempt by the masses to raise themselves up past a certain level
    imposed on them from above.


    Plato argued thousands of years ago that, for the good of society, there must
    be a ruling class that uses its power to protect the good, and that noble lies
    were necessary to shepherd the less evolved.  And for thousands of years we''ve
    seen these ideas corrupted over and over again and turned into implacable systems
    of raw exploitation garnished with ignoble lies to justify the hijacking of the
    human race.


    At this juncture in history, the situation is being reappraised.  Karl Poppers
    refutation of Plato is the approved doctrine among the elites, and the humanities
    have been systemically dismantled which makes a reasoned refutation of the elites
    functionally impossible.  As they say, those that make peaceful change impossible
    make violent revolution inevitable.


    The contradictions, injustices, and insanity presided over by the global financial
    elites are obvious to everyone, the cracks in Western society are so wide they
    encompass the diameter of the entire solar system.


    The elders are indeed flawed humans, but they deserve no respect and must be made
    a historical example of for future generations if humanity is to survive.'

        body: Just don't think we need to apply collective guilt to gone generations
          when, most of them had no say in the big picture, and, especially how many
          of them lived in much more ecologically conscious ways despite possessing
          less scientific information. Many youth today like to pretend to be ecological,
          yet live opposite to the values they claim to promote and they do this consciously
          and with bounty of scientific information available. I think most criticism
          blaming older generations for the state of the world comes from a place
          of ignorance, hypocrisy and false self-righteousness.

              Recommended reading: ''Can Life Prevail?''


              Some boomers are living okay, some are not. It''s not okay to generalize.
              Wealth also does not equal happiness.


              It''s a bit more complicated. First of all, what they inherited was
              opportunity. They plaid the minor part in the tragedy but not are they
              solely, or even primarily responsible for the state of economy. If you
              want someone to blame, look at the bankers and politicians instead of
              the workers?


              Most people living today have higher quality of life than most people
              living 50 years ago. The biggest problems are homelessness and lack
              of mental and physical health care and rehabilitation, but mostly mental,
              all of which are completely solvable problems if we get our act together.
              Everything beyond that, the current generations does not deserve. If
              the new generations want into boomer nirvana, they gonna have to earn
              it, and it starts by stop blaming your parents, stop being a hypocrite,
              take responsibility for yourself and your parents and be the change
              you want to see.'

                          will be murdered, women will be forced into sexual or laboral
                          slavery, countries will be toppled and their governments
                          and rights replaced, because of your idiot games. First
                          take the army of cruise missiles aimed at Syrian children
                          out of your own eye and then take the stick out of your
                          brother''s eye. If you haven''t already. You want to apply
                          collective guilt to an entire generation of humans for things
                          they did 50 years ago, yet you cant even see the guilt in
                          yourself in the only moment that is real. America is not
                          evil, it''s just run, and has been at times run, by evil
                          people. Evil people like the people who you glorify on Reddit.
                          There is no country or people on earth that does not have
                          this problem. Evil is part of the nature of man and corruption
                          inherently arises in the systems that he creates.'
