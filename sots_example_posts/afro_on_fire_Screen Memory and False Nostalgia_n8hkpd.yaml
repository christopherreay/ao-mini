    body: "From what I know, the Mandela effect deals more with the warping of collective\
      \ thought. What I\u2019m referring to here is the importance placed on memories\
      \ that are retroactively heightened in their importance/emotional value."

      body: oh yeah, definitely. like post 1968 the collective memory of mass movements
        is in fact easily hijacked by the captured images and media narratives around
        them, overwriting actual lived experiences as the less-spectacular memories
        get washed out, and by '99 you see Western-protest culture lose much of it's
        actual political power, as all other tactical or strategic considerations
        are dropped beyond becoming a "protest spectacle". they become rituals of
        representation, and their size seems to inversely correlate with their effect.

  body: The two arguments here that I'm seeing is one where a person focuses on the
    nostalgia and one where a person rationalizes the memory for recollection of a
    fact whereas one is based in, and for, getting lost in the moment the other is
    typically founded by a product of thought, intentions vary. Imk if this holds
    any water

This, one of Freudâ€™s theories, deals with mundane memories of a visual nature usually being magnified in importance later on.
At face value, I initially took this as something relating to images and screens in memory formation. One could argue, though, that its literal implications has some bearing?
I am curious if anyone else studied this sort of thing, how we internalize the Spectacle in our memories and how they may be hijacked by false nostalgia.
