    \nHaven\u2019t read it yet. Found it on Google\nScholar via the query \u201Ctrauma\
    \ and the symbolic\u201D. I would guess that anomalous experience, traumas, affect\
    \ and suffering carry much of the burden of \u201Cconsciousness\u201D but also\
    \ do much of the work in the expansion and evolution of consciousness."

I don’t remember if it was a Foreign Objekt talk by some speakers that brought this idea up or if it was written somewhere, but I vaguel remember a passage about the experience of “images” unknowingly being traumatic through their interconnectedness. Am I just off the goop or is this written anywhere?
