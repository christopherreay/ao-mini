    body: 'Why does self referential get a check?  This category seems to align with
      "Indeterminate" and albeit a little less, "Strange Loop".  A strange loop exceeds
      the categorical understanding - it''s sum is greater than it''s parts.


      And self referential + indeterminate *may* imply meaninglessness, but not necessarily.'

      body: "It was just a shitpost, but by self referential I meant that it is a\
        \ matter of identity and that all occurences of 'true' identify the same concept\
        \ in all languages subject to logic. We might have to distinguish between\
        \ 'true' and truthfulness (or as Frege called it \"Wahrhaftigkeit\" also meaning\
        \ 'veracity').\n\nI think the way we handle 'true' as a value of truthiness\
        \ to verify a fact could be compared to how we handle 0 (or any number) in\
        \ counting things. We can write many zeroes in many languages and symbols,\
        \ but they all refer to the same idea of the abstract 0, of which theres only\
        \ really one, although expressed in many different ways.\n\nIf we take some\
        \ mathematical formula and replace one of the 0 it contains with another 0\
        \ it doesn't change anything in the result, nor in the process to get that\
        \ result. The other 0 is just a different sign for the same 0 that refers\
        \ back to itself. The idea doesn't make sense to begin with, because there's\
        \ no 'other 0'. You don't clone a 0 into another 0 and you don't ever compare\
        \ two different 0 to eachother in order to find out how they are different,\
        \ because there's no such thing as different 0s. They are not only equivalent,\
        \ they are identical.\n\nI argue the same is true for 'true'. There's only\
        \ one true 'true' and while it is an abstract concept, it's still not a clone\
        \ or a copy of some other hidden 'master-true', so it's refering to itself\
        \ in so far as the truthiness of the value 'true' evaluates back to 'true'\
        \ just as the numerical value of 0 is the same 0 as itself. \n\nI think many\
        \ things may be considered truthy. In fact i consider most of the things to\
        \ be veracious. Basically everything except for the empty set (there's also\
        \ only one of those too), the number 0 and maybe any cup of coffee that is\
        \ empty)."

      body: "I think I misunderstood the terms metalanguage and object language when\
        \ I wrote that. I was thinking of object language as the physical and explicit\
        \ use of language (e.g. spoken word or written language as acts of communicating\
        \ in a way someone else can interpret) and metalanguage as the process of\
        \ transferring our thoughts into a communicative form (e.g. when we make a\
        \ concept in our minds something we can articulate through language for someone\
        \ else to understand). \n\nNow that I'm rereading the question and your responses\
        \ it looks more like you're using object language to refer to things in the\
        \ world and metalanguage to refer to language outside of that (language about\
        \ language). Your use definitely makes much more sense.\n\nBecause we were\
        \ talking about different terms, my original explanation doesn't help with\
        \ your question much but I wanna articulate what I was trying to say in case\
        \ you get anything out of it (plus I want to better understand what I was\
        \ saying myself)\n\nThere's almost definitely scholarly terms for what I'm\
        \ trying to describe but I don't know them, so I'll refer to my original understanding\
        \ of object language as \"the act of communicating\" and my original understanding\
        \ of metalanguage as \"concepts pre-articulation\"\n\nAs for the difference\
        \ between signification and denotation, I'm currently reading The Logic of\
        \ Sense by Gilles Deleuze (which I strongly recommend), and I'm still trying\
        \ to grasp his meaning behind these terms but here's my current understanding.\
        \ Denotation is when a proposition signifies an object in the world, whereas\
        \ signification is when a proposition signifies a concept. That's definitely\
        \ an oversimplification that doesn't do the book justice but that's what I\
        \ got so far.\n\nI don't see truth as being an object within the world, but\
        \ as a concept that is reliant on subjective thought (truth only means anything\
        \ if there is a being to have accurate or inaccurate understandings of reality,\
        \ in which case the concept of truth would reflect if a particular belief\
        \ is accurate to reality or not). \n\nIn this way I see the act of communicating\
        \ \"truth\" as being a simulacrum of the concept pre-articulation.\n\nSorry\
        \ if this isn't the scholarly terminology/gibberish, I'm much more of a hobbyist\
        \ philosophy fan as opposed to a properly schooled philosopher"
