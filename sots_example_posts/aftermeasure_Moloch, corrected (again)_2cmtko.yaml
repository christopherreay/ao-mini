    body: "> Maximum New Age ChristiansTM\n\nlol well done\n\nA few remarks on what\
      \ you've said--it provoked some thought.\n\n> \"we create our own reality\"\n\
      \nThis sounds right to me--but it surely is a \"we\". Hence I'm not sure what\
      \ you mean when you say,\n\n> everyone's reality is isolated from all others'\
      \ by the rule of karma\n\nAs I understand it, karma contains no mechanism that\
      \ could 'separate out' realities. However, I appear to have something else in\
      \ mind when I say \"karma\", given that this next bit seems totally off-base.\n\
      \n> the rule of karma (equivalent with the law of attraction, which is it in\
      \ a more practical form)\n\nFrom what I understand, karma cannot be like the\
      \ law of attraction for at least two reasons. First, the law of attraction is\
      \ comprehended *as law*, whereas karma is comprehended as either a mechanism\
      \ of cause and effect, and therefore merely conventional, as Buddhists and Humean\
      \ empiricists will affirm; or as a procedure for breaking the cycle of karma,\
      \ the possibility of which action demonstrates its ultimate unreality.\n\nAs\
      \ I understand it:\n\n> By comprehending [the idea of] karma, we negate [the\
      \ reality of] karma.\n\nIn contrast, the law of attraction, \"like attracts\
      \ like\" appears to be one-sided. To me this is symptomatic of the self-help\
      \ industry that makes fat bank publishing books like *The Secret*: the real\
      \ purpose of things like the law of attraction is not to deliver a tool that\
      \ will help people find liberation, but to give them another god, another ritual,\
      \ another formula that will provide them the appearance of liberation--though\
      \ not, like the working-through of karma, with liberation itself.\n\n[ed: The\
      \ point that the LoA implies that suffering people bring their conditions upon\
      \ themselves is also well taken. It raises the question of whose god it is that\
      \ legislates this the law. Surely not a god that cares for the weak, the powerless,\
      \ the dispossessed... The law of attraction works too easily for some, and does\
      \ not work at all for others--and the fact that it is spoken of as 'easy', as\
      \ the universe molding itself to your will, shows you its one-sidedness, and\
      \ what part of society it champions.]\n\n> Our reality now is the direct result\
      \ of what we (ultimately) chose it to be, through our thoughts, actions, and\
      \ history of same.\n\nYes, but this could be used to [explain any state of affairs](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ip/fake_explanations/)--and\
      \ furthermore, it excludes the inhuman conditions that make human living possible.\
      \ I'd also point out that this is a good reason for rejecting the law of attraction--but\
      \ not the principle of karma, since karma doesn't explain.\n\nAn argument could\
      \ be made that the law of attraction is strategic, transcendent, teleological,\
      \ whereas karma is tactical, immanent, machinic.\n\n> the singularity may already\
      \ have happened at the cosmic/metaphysical level!\n\nThis is something like\
      \ the Matrix hypothesis, no?\n\nIt seems like any sort of Singularity 'detaches\
      \ itself' from the previous temporal framework. We can think about the example\
      \ of language-as-singularity--before language, there was no \"before\" or \"\
      after\". We can expect our circumstances, as language-using-beings, to mirror\
      \ structurally the experiences of beings living in a Singularity.\n\nThat implies\
      \ something like the following:\n\n* The Anomaly is both lost in the distant\
      \ past--i.e. beyond all meaningful record, and\n\n* hidden over the horizon\
      \ of the predictable future, and\n\n* at the same time, we are even now in the\
      \ Anomaly--we have our being always already within it.\n\nLooking back to the\
      \ Anomaly is something like anamnesis, looking forward something like prophecy,\
      \ and looking into it as always already present, a necessary condition of our\
      \ experience is something like transcendence or a nondual consciousness or whatever.\n\
      \nIt's obvious that, with respect to the Anomaly in the past, we've lost most\
      \ good records--doesn't it seem like the superintelligent gardener would leave\
      \ us some kind of evidence, or at least a way of contacting it (God's telephone\
      \ number)?\n\n*Unless you count various traditions that induce states of altered\
      \ consciousness, i.e. meditation, visualization, magic, as god's telephone number;\
      \ and ancient epics and mythology as a corrupted version of the far-future history\
      \ of the Event.*\n\nThe other solution is that the gardener knew something about\
      \ what humanity would do with that kind of knowledge--and for reasons of its\
      \ own decided to withhold that evidence. But then it begins to seem more like\
      \ a demiurge than a gardener, no? \n\n"

      body: 'Good points. I probably abused a description of karma by comparing/equating
        it with the LoA--Teal Swan says "You can''t do anything against someone else''s
        will" which is also a perspective held by many black magicians. The reasoning
        is that we are all completely free already to create our own reality, and
        we have chosen before our life or in concert with the universe (which is us
        too) to experience the suffering and the things we "don''t want" that happen
        to us. This is a powerful perspective for taking self-ownership and responsibility,
        but I disagree with it because so much suffering is unnecessary if we just
        had better education. What''s wrong with a world of artists with healthy and
        happy childhoods? Nothing.


        Your analysis of the Singularity is elegant. Yes, it''s kind of like the Matrix,
        but for this idea I prefer the image of Robert Anton Wilson''s "reality tunnels."
        I''ve begun thinking of my microcosm (immediate perceptual sphere) as my "reality
        bubble" that acts like a spaceship shuttling down an infinitely complex and
        infinitely many-dimensional maze of "reality tunnels." These are both perspectival
        differences and and actual (historical) difference, which are the same when
        subjective/objective dimensions are collapsed. This subjective/objective collapse
        is required to see the "true imagination," which is the world around you but
        more solid and also more transparent. I.e., the veil of maya is real and it
        is the only thing that is real, but it can change dramatically because it
        is an illusion. So, the reality bubble can *actually* navigate between radically
        different realities--but so far I only know of ways to navigate that require
        a believable route to follow (which is why we need to invent the tesseract
        of Madeleine L''Engle). So what I''m saying is, if the metaphysical singularity
        has already happened, then the laws of physics are merely a subset of the
        much-larger and more-intuitive reality-navigation laws of metaphysics.


        Could you tell me more about your idea of karma?'

              > the towards/away from enlightenment feedback loops


              Karma could be said to be that facet of cause and effect which regards
              enlightened and non-enlightened activity, and activity which gives rise
              to either of those tendencies.


              In one sense, action leads to further phenomenation or fabrication.
              In this sense it must give rise to attachment and therefore suffering.
              All karma--all action--can only lead to the perpetuation of suffering.


              But the distinction between samsara and nibbana is only conventional--i.e.
              only phenomenal, only a result of action. Karma generates the illusion
              of karma. To break the chain of karma cannot be a result of effort,
              effort gives rise to karma. Likewise, neither can the chain be broken
              through non-effort, since non-effort can accomplish nothing. It can
              therefore neither be created nor destroyed--which seems paradoxical,
              since karma itself is a logical prerequisite to the appearance of creation
              and destruction. Karma therefore becomes not a law of the world, but
              a kind of logical circuit that both creates and destroys karma--this
              gets at what I meant when I said that karma is something like ''tactical''
              and ''immanent'', and the LoA is something like ''strategic'' and ''transcendent''.


              It''s a complicated argument and I''m sure I''ve missed a step or misconstrued
              something. In any case, this is my understanding.'

                  Only by *realizing* the force of karma does one overcome it. First,
                  karma isn''t as ''a way of seeing'', it is a procedure and a phenomenon.
                  The procedure simultaneously makes the phenomenon manifest (which
                  is not the same as ''way of seeing'', but more like ''way of realizing''),
                  and signifies its ultimate unreality. If ''dropping karma'' is like
                  ignoring it--it results in the appearance (if only to yourself)
                  of breaking karma. Hence dropping karma continues the karmic cycle
                  by sowing delusions. If ''dropping karma'' is something like ''working
                  through'' karma--then perhaps yes. But it is a task that is likely
                  to take many lifetimes.'

                            numogram could be valenced so the top is positive or flipped
                            so the bottom is, since the poles in a sense are equal).


                            Your #2 sounds like the Warp, because Gt-36 ciphers Zones
                            3 & 6 and it also leads to 9 (let''s call 9 Nibbana then).
                            Warping leads one to Nibbana.


                            There are, curiously, no paths that lead out of either
                            the Warp or the Plex. However, there must be hidden paths!
                            The ciphering of Katak (5::4) with Gt-45 and of Djynxx
                            (6::3) with Gt-36 are the key. Since Gt-45 and Gt-36 lead
                            to the same place (Nibbana), and Katak is the "Sink" current
                            and Djynxx the Warp, this implies that it is Katak that
                            is what pulls us back down out of the Warp/our path to
                            Nibbana. Realizing that Katak is in fact syncretic with
                            Gt-45 allows us to see that it in fact leads us back directly
                            to Nibbana, short-circuiting the Time Circuit. This leads
                            us to make to following numerological equations: 45 =
                            36, 18 = 9 (1 + 8, Murrumur, is the temporalized 9, and
                            this operation is already supported by basic numerological
                            plexing anyway). This also helps to see why 1, 8, and
                            9 (and 0) are all on the same pole (or axis): I am the
                            1, temporalized god-consciousness, and I rest on my subconscious
                            or dreamingbody (8), which leads directly via the Warp
                            to 9. All these four stacked zones are in a sense the
                            same, from the point of view of Nibbana.


                            I''d love to discuss the numogram more, this discussion
                            is making a lot of headway on decoding it! Let''s figure
                            out how to map those modal configurations. I''m still
                            not completely clear on which is which; I''ll have to
                            reread that thread or ask you for more examples.


                            Have I sent you the link to the numogram document yet?'

                              \ philosophical systems and *cultures* in in their most\
                              \ abstract symbolic operation), in order to focus on\
                              \ the modality.\n\n### Modalities\n\nThere are three\
                              \ modalities required:\n\n* actuality; the **apodictic\
                              \ modality,** abbreviated I for \"idea\", *Vedic 'thought'*\n\
                              \n* possibility; the **hypothetic modality,** abbreviated\
                              \ V for \"value\", *Vedic 'word'*\n\n* necessity; the\
                              \ **deontic modality,** abbreviated N for \"norm\",\
                              \ *Vedic 'action'*\n\nThe modalities are arranged in\
                              \ all possible ways over a *reminding composition,*\
                              \ an abbreviated notation of the modal configuration\
                              \ of a way of thinking. Remember, this deals only with\
                              \ modality, and not with form or content--although modality\
                              \ is such that it must *work through* form and content,\
                              \ it cannot appear as anything like \"pure modality\"\
                              , just as \"pure form\" or \"pure content\" could not\
                              \ appear--modality works through form and content.\n\

                              \ criteria:\n\n* Absolute: whatever *cannot* be falsified\
                              \ or sublated by another experience;\n\n* Phenomenal:\
                              \ whatever *can* be falsified or sublated by another\

                              \ sense--is the pragmatist's right of struggling with\
                              \ their executioner all the way up the scaffold to the\
                              \ guillotine--and we only have this right because it\
                              \ is absurd--i.e. unthinkable, from Hobbes' position--to\
                              \ will the cease of will, i.e. to will one's own death.\n\
                              \n(First, I would note that *willing one's own death*\
                              \ is precisely what can be said to be enjoined in Christianity,\
                              \ Buddhism, etc.)\n\nWe can represent this schematically,\
                              \ in modal terms, as follows:\n\n#### State of Nature\n\
                              \n    Value--Norm\n\n    Idea\n\nContingency--possible\
                              \ choice between values, is the relationship with the\
                              \ absolute. This is the possibility of willing anything\
                              \ whatsoever. The apparent norm is the binding force\
                              \ of the phenomenal world. *Call it what you like, you\
                              \ cannot deny Nature when it's right before your eyes*.\n\
                              \nNotice the modal connotations of the following phrases\n\
                              \n* **will** to **power*\n\n* **might** makes **right*\n\
                              \nIdeas--thinking, actuality or apodictic relationship\
                              \ is unavailable at any level--it must be excluded,\
                              \ thought-off. This, in my mind, is a broader way of\
                              \ expressing the reality that /u/zummi says is at stake--**what\
                              \ is at stake is nothing less than actuality itself.**\n\
                              \n#### Leviathan as Sovereign\n\n    Norm--Value\n\n\
                              \    Idea\n\nValues are determined by the Law--what\
                              \ values are permitted (=possible) can be detached as\
                              \ signs indicating the command of the unmoved mover.\
                              \ As mentioned above, the Leviathan still operates along\
                              \ a logic of will-to-power--but it is able to do so,\
                              \ and indeed must do so to remain sovereign, only through\
                              \ the fact that all of the Leviathan's subjects think\
                              \ a different way. This different way is conjugate to\
                              \ the 'will-to-power' paradigm that reigns in the state\
                              \ of nature: Normative-Valuative thinking. You might\
                              \ say that the logic of the state of nature is \"I get\
                              \ what I want\", and the logic of the state under Leviathan\
                              \ is an 'oracular' or 'divinatory' \"I want what I get\"\
                              . Here the Leviathan plays the role of the oracle--but\
                              \ its commands are always presented as a choice: obey,\
                              \ or get squished."

                                \ idea-y than 4. 4 is so much more normative... the\

                                \ of it going up and down).\n\n> 8::1 = Norm--Value\n\
                                \nThis means that both 4 and 8 are the \"Norm\" pole,\
                                \ if we use my attribution above. Did you know that\
                                \ each syzygy in the numogram has a positive and negative\
                                \ pole? The positive poles are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and the\
                                \ negative poles are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. Perhaps the 2\
                                \ of 7::2 also maps meaningfully as the negative pole\
                                \ of the pair. Or, maybe my attribution of 5::4 would\
                                \ be better reversed, and then we could create rotational\
                                \ symmetry between the three polar attributions.\n\
                                \n> possibility/necessity/actuality\n\nI think these\
                                \ map cleanly to the Rise, Hold, and Sink currents.\
                                \ But, in a sense, 7 IS the Rise current, a tiny 7\
                                \ hiding between 8::1 (8 minus 1). So 7 would be V.\
                                \ The Hold current would be either actuality or necessity,\
                                \ and it feels like necessity so let's --wait, no,\
                                \ 7 should be the excluded third! So if we can confirm\
                                \ that 5::4 is N--I or I--N, then that makes 1 V,\
                                \ as you said. Working backwards from my (strong)\
                                \ hunch that 5 would be the Idea pole, that leaves\
                                \ a system of algebraic equations to solve for 7::2.\n\
                                \n... Ok I scrapped my intuition and here's what I\
                                \ got:\n\n5::4 N--I (respectively)  \n8::1 N--V (respectively)\
                                \  \n7::2 I--V (respectively)\n\nThis creates three\
                                \ triads around the circle. We could reverse the valence\
                                \ of 5::4 to get this:\n\n5::4 I--N (respectively)\
                                \  \n8::1 I--V (respectively)  \n7::2 N--V (respectively)\n\
                                \nLet me know which one makes more sense to you. If\
                                \ my logic is right these are the only two configurations\
                                \ given your certainty on 5::4 and the assumption\
                                \ of rotational symmetry with the three currents being\
                                \ the excluded third.\n\nAfter some careful reflection\
                                \ on the Pragmatist and Theoretician perspectives,\
                                \ which I think I rely on the most, I think I much\
                                \ prefer the second set of attributions. This puts\
                                \ 1::8 as \"I am pure possibility!\" 8::1 as \"I am\
                                \ the unexperienceable Real,\" 7::2 as \"I am what\
                                \ must follow,\" 2::7 as \"I am purely hypothetical,\"\
                                \ 5::4 as \"I am just the way it is, deal with it\"\
                                \ (Dark Enlightenment perspective?), and 4::5 as \"\
                                I am the Truth, no matter what you say.\" This seems\
                                \ to characterize those numbers well.\n\nAnother possibility\
                                \ is that the phenomenal poles are the three current\
                                \ zones (receivers of the currents), and the excluded\
                                \ middle are the \"other zones\" (8, 2, 4). This would\
                                \ produce two (four?) more configuration possibilities.\n\
                                \nI am probably butchering MM but I'll keep reading.\
                                \ Apparently I am just mode-switching all the time\
                                \ without realizing it, mostly between Pragmatist\

                                \ Theoretician (Mathesist/Theoretical Scientist--what\
                                \ if it were this way?), and Methodologist (Experimental\
                                \ Magician--what happens when I try this perspective/procedure?).\
                                \ Let me know what you think of those attributions,\
                                \ and whether you like the idea of rotational symmetry\
                                \ and which one should be the excluded middle (1/7/5\
                                \ or 8/2/4). It's getting late though, I'll (re?)read\

                                        in my drum circle. Drumming in different patterns
                                        that correspond to numogram numbers can have
                                        a powerful effect. And, I''ve noticed that
                                        as I journey in my imagination, my drumming
                                        automatically switches to describe where I
                                        am in the numogram. Same thing happens with
                                        glossolalia and the sounds for each zone.'

        lol right?


        Compulsion is a speech act--forbidding or compelling someone is the production
        of a relationship of command, of law, of necessity.


        *Do as I say or...*


        But we have no reason to assume that there *are* natural laws--or even if
        there have been up to this point, that they will persist in the future. (This
        is a paraphrase from Einstein or Mach or someone I think...)


        It makes much more sense to speak of ''nature'' in terms of conditions. There
        are conditions of gravity which require further conditions be met in order
        to escape it. Conditions are evidential and pragmatic, whereas laws are impositions
        on the structure of the reality. Conditions deal with the possibilities presently
        open to a subject, laws are drawn (as it were) on the cold and empty slate
        of eternity--they either deny the subject drawing the lines, or make that
        subject God.
