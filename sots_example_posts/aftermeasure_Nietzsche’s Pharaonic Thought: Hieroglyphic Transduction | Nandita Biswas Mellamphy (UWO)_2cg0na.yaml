  body: "> With the notion of the \xDCbermensch, Nietzsche is not seeking to \u201C\
    re-establish a notion of noble human agency,\u201D but rather of a notion of an\
    \ overhuman agency which would be the very direction of the Earth (its direction\
    \ toward the overhuman is what would make this notion of agency \u2018noble\u2019\
    \ rather than \u2018base\u2019). The human (anthropos) is transfigured and made\
    \ a transductor (a bridge and conduit, but also a carrier and conversion mechanism)\
    \ for the overhuman insofar as the human is made to become a pro-gram, a circuit\
    \ that is also a scene of writing or \u201Csurface of inscription,\u201D that\
    \ connects the human to the generative Dionysian, overhuman, trans-individual,\
    \ cosmic matrix. As Babette Babich suggests, the \xDCbermensch is a lesson in\
    \ self-overcoming as the vehicle for teaching the \u201Cfundamental relatedness\
    \ of all living things.\u201D The human, as such, is the formative, informational\
    \ material \u2014 the hypertextual type-writing that leads toward (e-ducere) the\
    \ overhuman. The human, in this sense, can be seen as a hiero-glyph \u2014 but\
    \ always incarnated, chthonic and material, never idealized, ideal or Idea \u2014\
    \ an inscription that always leads beyond the human by way of the self-overcoming\
    \ human (this is what makes the human \u2018sacred,\u2019 as in \u2018hiero\u2019\
    ): \u201CIn man there is material, fragment, excess, clay, dirt, nonsense, chaos;\
    \ but in man there is also creator, form-giver, hammer hardness.\u201D\n"
