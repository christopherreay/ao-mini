      Agreed.

      Most of humanity won''t accept that yet--you can say, "AI is here already",
      but that statement carries no force, or only a force which is easily counteracted
      by a cultural bewitchment. That was a major part of what I got from the article.
      As long as intelligences of any kind are subordinated to the economic & political
      logic that dominates our society, we will be systematically unable to produce
      varieties of minds that would bring us beyond that logic--the varieties of minds
      which would provide the best hope of staving off extinction. (As you rightly
      point out--not all minds that fit with the current paradigm of ''human consciousness''.)
