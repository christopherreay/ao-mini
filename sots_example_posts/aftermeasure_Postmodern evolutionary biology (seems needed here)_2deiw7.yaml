    \ a few weeks ago.  \n\nFirstly, I feel just obliged to say how crazy it is that\
    \ epigenetics does not factor into questions like this.  Let's remember that the\
    \ human and chimpanzee genomes differ by only ~3-4%.  This means that the huge\
    \ differences between us and chimps are due to either just a small handful of\
    \ genes, OR we remember there's this thing called epigenetics.  Darwinism will\
    \ be a dead paradigm in 25years.  \n\nSecondly, to put on my sorcerer's hat, it\
    \ should be recognized that Darwinism is not a biological explanation, Darwinism\
    \ is an ideological shift that is a crucial element of the entire materialist\
    \ worldview.  Darwinism came along and proclaimed that teleology is dead.  Darwin\
    \ went to the Galapagos and noticed that some finches developed beak upgrades\
    \ and explained it as the interaction between the environment and populations.\
    \  Darwinism combined this with genetic theory to say that biology is reducible\
    \ to randomness.  \n\nThe ideology was co-opted in the socioeconomic realm as\
    \ *Social Darwinism*.  Then the fact that Darwin may have largely ripped off Russel,\
    \ cemented the reality of social darwinism with the historical nature of his own\
    \ ascent.  And that's a juicy sorcerous tidbit that doesn't get talked about much.\

      Your understanding of the state of biology puzzles me--most of the biologists
      whose work I read, or whom I know personally, would not hesitate to acknowledge
      the importance of epigenetic effects. May I ask what scientists/institutions/books
      you have in mind when you suggest that people are ignoring these phenomena?


      He doesn''t mention epigenetics in the article because it''s not relevant to
      the argument he''s making. It''s a criticism of the naive picture of evolution
      that seems to have been installed in popular knowledge of science. The context
      is a continuing debate in which PZ''s position has more than a [little nuance.](http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2014/02/13/both-wrong/)


      Also, PZ Myers is a developmental biologist--his field of research depends on
      [a theory of epigenetic effects.](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/07/22/epigenetics/)


      The use of the word "Darwinism" is problematic. As you''re using it, it''s a
      highly equivocal term--"social Darwinism" is a construction based on such equivocation.
      A co-option, as you said, and not a proper use.


      > Darwinism ~~will be a dead paradigm in 25years.~~ was probably dead before
      1940.


      There have been a number of paradigm shifts that have changed the meanings or
      truth values of the vast majority of statements that could be taken to comprise
      a ''theory of evolution''. "Darwinism" conflates this fragmentary landscape
      of divergent methods and motivations into a single position--inevitably resulting
      in category errors when interpreting ideas. This happens both for pro-Darwinism
      and anti-Darwinism types, of course--my objection is based on the errors that
      arise when knowledge is transferred between paradigms without a clear understanding
      of the relations that obtain between those paradigms.


      > Darwin may have largely ripped off Russel


      As much as I like the self-referentiality of your sorcerous narrative, I''m
      afraid the evidence for it [is questionable.](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/aug/09/charles-darwin-alfred-russel-wallace)


      **Calling the theory of evolution "Darwinism" is like calling philosophy "Platonism".**


      Sciency folks get hate from anti-science types. People who go in for religion
      get hate from the anti-religion types. But people who do philosophy of science
      get hate from every quarter, and must at the same time remain more sympathetic
      to any given position than anyone except for members of that position. What
      a world. :-/'

        \nPerhpas it would be more fair to say that the scope of epigenetics is not\

        \nIn this study, mice were conditioned to associate the smell of a certain\
        \ odorant with an electric shock, causing a fear response.  Their progeny,\
        \ two generations later were shown to have increased expression of the odorant\
        \ receptor and the associated neuroanatomical changes.  This means that *learned\
        \ behavior* is affecting the phenotypes of progeny two generations later on\
        \ the molecular and neuroanatomical levels.  That's huge!!!!  It re-writes\
        \ almost everything we know about trait inheritance.  Of course genetic mutations\
        \ can affect progeny phenotypes, but those types of changes are the exception.\
        \  \n\nYour interactions with the environment are constantly re-tuning how\
        \ your DNA is expressed.  Those expression patterns, it now seems, are passed\
        \ on to progeny as well.  \n\nSo, when this guy paints with a broad brush\
        \ about 'Evolutionary Theory', he can't be presenting anything but a limited\
        \ view if there is zero nod to epigenetics.  But I guess he's right, the state\
        \ of modern 'evolutionary theory' is not what you think it is.    "

          I think we agree on many points, I''m just saying that the future is arriving
          fast enough that your pessimism is premature.


          Natural selection isn''t a material mechanism--it''s a logical construction:
          a model or map of what occurs given certain conditions. And an interpretation
          of any theory that takes its maps for its territories will always end up
          reifying its own procedures as natural law. PZ''s criticism of this is simply
          that the conditions under which natural selection would be the main determinant
          of trends simply do not apply (horizontal gene transfer, endosymbiosis,
          and quasi-Lamarckian phenomena are all mentioned in the article).He''s making
          a negative argument against a bad idea--not making a positive argument for
          which he''d have to (as a working scientist) amass a body of peer-reviewed
          data. That''s not to say that such data doesn''t exist, just that the sciences
          are so disorganized and the state of science journalism and science education
          more generally are so poor that any of the technical information that does
          exist on the biochemical mechanisms of epigenetics is going to be inaccessible
          until people catch up with the state of the disciplines in question.'
