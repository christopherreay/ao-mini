  body: "I will watch some of the lectures before I make any comment of real note\
    \ towards the article.\n\nHowever this is a fantastic article and really gets\
    \ at one of the corner stones of philosophical and religious thought: irreverence.\
    \ \n\n\xFCbermensch-wagons is Paticulary poignant since I am currently an Alaskan\
    \ and even though I engage in critical thought around university circles I also\
    \ end up playing in the darker underbelly of my community. Driving around in an\
    \ old refurbished ford ranger which frequently has a copy of my 1913 Oxford english\
    \ book of prose as well as a philosophical/religious tome of some sort (as of\
    \ late it's either a series of epicurean discourses or the TTC). I enjoy engaging\
    \ the philosophical undercurrent of the works with those traveling in those circles\
    \ on an applied basis.\n\nI will update my thoughts once I get some first hand\
    \ experience with the lectures but overall that was a great read."

  body: I actually decided to watch the lectures before reading the article. The lectures
    are on point. I just finished the one on Marcuse, and I'm glad he brought up Alienation
    in the Marxist sense. I feel like very few people are familiar with this concept
    formally, but I think most people are familiar with it practically whether they
    know it or not. IMO, there are so many things that Marx was right about that are
    too often ignored.
