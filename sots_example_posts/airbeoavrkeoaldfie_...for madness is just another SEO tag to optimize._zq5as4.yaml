selftext: "Hydraulics of pornography did not allow for implosion, for madness is just\
  \ another SEO tag to optimize. While pumping his action shotgun Gre almost left\
  \ through a slur, but then he remembered what he was doing and said it louder: \"\
  You like that, you little nigger?\" His partner obeying the raisin-de-thre for this\
  \ whole ordeal responded automatically, \"yes daddy, you so thick!\" Raisin. A little\
  \ nugget of shit on Gre's dick. \"This idiot didn't do the enema right.\" \"What's\
  \ that?\" The camera man, also producer and also director of the set, asked because\
  \ he was too busy looking through camera to see what's happening. \"I got shit on\
  \ my dick.\" \"Oh damn, this one is out. We'll shoot this in an hour.\" Just like\
  \ that, the sweet cash payout for filming gay flick was delayed, although Gre already\
  \ forgot what was the sum or what's his plan. It doesn't matter. \n\nSo what does\
  \ matter? Gre quickly diffused to the bathroom to wash his limping dick but couldn't\
  \ for the life of him find something that matters on the mirror shelf. He said that\
  \ thing because it gets clicks on the platform, and the black guy said something\
  \ else for that reason too. The reason that one's black is that there's a small\
  \ niche to fill, you fill it with cum and you get little nuggets of shit money in\
  \ return. \"Black submissive femboy interracial dom cuck blowjob\", that one's for\
  \ ages. Maybe it'll earn Gre like $300 in about a month. It doesn't matter. Does\
  \ not. \n\nWhat does matter? Gre looked at his wrinkled hands. He's 45 and halfway\
  \ homeless, earning through porn gigs and buried his father just yesterday. \"This\
  \ is the thing that matters least\", he said for some reason. He could stab a dude,\
  \ and it doesn't matter. He doesn't hate that guy, he's not racist, he's the least\
  \ racist person, he defeated the racism, he's the kike of racists, he's the nigger\
  \ of kikes, it doesn't matter, Gre thought. He could stab that dude and it wouldn't\
  \ matter. He could kill himself and it would be the last thing that matters (he\
  \ said that again). He could buy a gun and shoot up a school and it would not matter\
  \ still. \"Hey, where're you going?\" \"It doesn't matter.\" \"We'll be shooting\
  \ in 40 minutes, don't make us wait.\" \"I'll shoot the shit.\", although producer\
  \ didn't hear that last one. \n\nHe diffused (not sublimated) again; through lice\
  \ ridden AIDS of the tropolis (pedestrians were the lice and the city lights - the\
  \ AIDS). If some parent wanted to get his kid napped in broad daylight of the tropolis\
  \ and it was walking through docks unattended, Gre could easily fulfill someone's\
  \ semiotic dream of showing a minor his dick, but what would be the purpose? Gre\
  \ was even mystified about why'd he bother to put on the coat. He could stab a dude\
  \ if he wanted, drink his intestines, \"Thank you, mister! See, there are still\
  \ good people around!\"\_ He could stab a grammy he just gave pocket change, and\
  \ it would not still matter. There are more good people in the world than there\
  \ are shit nuggets in the sewer, you could slather yourself in good people and jerk\
  \ off covered in them, and what difference does it make? It does. Not. Matter. \n\
  \nHere he is fucking some piece of shit on camera for some other pieces of shit\
  \ to jerk off for three minutes then forget they ever saw that, and the goodness\
  \ of their heart is only consequential to an organ pimp. So why does he need to\
  \ worry if he's a good person? He's a good person, the best person, he's a nigger\
  \ and a kike, \"moan you bitch, you like that yeah??\" \"Umm please daddy you so\
  \ big oh please.\"\_ Just yesterday he saw his father's dead body lowered into one\
  \ of city's numerous anuses, \"mmm daddy!!\" Body is shit, the city shits out your\
  \ body and then eats it back up 70 years later. The body is defecatious, it's horrid,\
  \ it's reverse vomit of the beast. Exhausted from life automaton is lowering the\
  \ body and all Gre is thinking about is what's the price for a nigger flick. (What\
  \ was it again? Gre forgot already.) The dude is batting away with a shovel, and\
  \ that's where you have to play well, these idiots will half of the time just skip\
  \ to the cumshot. Gre pulls out his dick and wordlessly signals, cumshot is here.\
  \ The black dude is gaping his mouth wide open, tongue out eyes corsetted. \"Yes\
  \ daddy I want your cum so hard!!\" Last swing of the shovel and just like that\
  \ father is no more, engulfed completely by the city's innards, (but wasn't he always?)\
  \ \n\n\"Hey, I told you, 40 minutes. We're waiting for you.\" \"It doesn't matter.\"\
  \ \"You want these bucks or not?\" \"...\" The city is shit, it is garbage, it is\
  \ waste and it is fuck. Just a twitching anxious pile of unscrupulous fuck, no end\
  \ to it and no beginning. Gre saw something under his feet on the way \"home\" but\
  \ kept walking. Wrist watch enumerated a useless number, 3 am/pm does not matter,\
  \ the lights all artificial anyway. High rise stack of pods, enter one and you get\
  \ shuffled by the machine. If you look up you see a monolithic wall of body containers,\
  \ you pay some to sleep for 6 hours then get out, pay some more to store your items.\
  \ The shuffler licks you up and pull-licks your down in the same place, just the\
  \ cases that move around. What was it that he saw under his feet? The city is a\
  \ flow of shit, you get absorbed or absolved it doesn't matter. \"Does. Not.\" Oh\
  \ how much Gre wishes to slit one of those veins, just a torrent of shit would be\
  \ a smell to behold. \"What is this??\" \n\nFrom the place that he wanted not to\
  \ notice there was an eye, staring right at him. Hundreds of feet walked around\
  \ that crevice in that hour but now there's nobody around, just him and the eye.\
  \ \"It's looking at me.\" \n\nFor hundreds of hours now did Gre think that the city\
  \ doesn't care about him. Just a particle of clothing in a mindless flow of gunk.\
  \ But now the city seems to be interested. What do you do with a disembodied eye?\
  \ \"You cut. That. Shit.\" Gre crawled a bit on all fours and tried to pierce through\
  \ the white with his index finger. Doesn't work, the eye is stiff although slightly\
  \ flexible, that is promising. Gre found the pod key chip in his pocket and tried\
  \ to pierce with a sharp edge of it. Works! The eye has burst out laughing, sorry,\
  \ merely burst out with latex tar. \"Shit, shit.\" Gre quickly backed out of the\
  \ crevice on all fours while trying to wipe away the filth from his hand, failing\
  \ miserably because the stench now slathered his whole jacket. He looked around\
  \ for a bush or a leaf, (what is this, the 20th century?), but found an ad leaflet\
  \ on the ground and wiped with it, finally. He then managed to look away from the\
  \ ground and what he saw was, well, obviously. It doesn't matter. \n\nAn enormous\
  \ corpse of a giant, littered with vaginal flesh wounds of anuses, dominated the\
  \ horizon. Only, as Gre realized, it was always there, gaping. \"Of course.\" The\
  \ city is an intestine, a flowing slate of fatty engorge, an intestinal worm that\
  \ gorges on people and shits them back out. At the top of the pile of giant there\
  \ is a nervous arp, a musical instrument made from connected nerve endings,\_ harmonious\
  \ plucks of live nerve wires firing for thousands of times a second. Every nerve\
  \ is connected to a living brain, a person who perceives the whole ordeal but is\
  \ unable to \xE6ffect except affirmatively, \"I will help you torture me in every\
  \ way as much as I can.\" They can't even stop. \n\nBelow that is a chalice of eyes,\
  \ chalice full of blood and urine, the eyes are there to moisturize the blood. Every\
  \ eye is looking in every direction at the same time, every eye sees every other\
  \ eye and also every other thing including Gre. Dripping down from that chalice\
  \ blood is helping the shit flow in and out of every anus, all gaping into the sky\
  \ and beyond. These openings let the shit flow through, every man a little dropplet\
  \ or nugget of bondage-laced pile of shit. You don't flow in the flow, you are the\
  \ flow, you are the vomit that the mouth beckons. \n\nThe sleeping pod monolith?\
  \ Another fold of necrotic labia, a giantess womb that only takes in. It's soothing\
  \ to think that the walls of your pod are cheap plastic sheen and gearboxes, but\
  \ the walls are alive, every square inch is seething with shit, every atom a qualia.\
  \ You run a knife on top of the terminal and out comes blood and urine. It's all\
  \ alive. \n\nGre realized now that he wasn't standing on pavement floor anymore\
  \ than he was standing on top of the moon mammary. \"It pulses with heat\", Gre\
  \ thought, wishing so much he was crushed to death by an unconscious twitch of the\
  \ corpse. But now he knows that the thing is fully conscious and knows of him. No\
  \ matter how much he bashes his head against the living rock, the skull would not\
  \ give way - pavement would curve away in just the right amount. \n\n\"What do you\
  \ want from me?\" Geriatric female, no known relatives, dead in three minutes of\
  \ incompetent strangling. \"I am killing her.\", Gre loudly proclaimed to the crowd\
  \ and to the giant, as if daring them to do something about it. No person cared\
  \ enough to stop, it's five in the morning, people need to get to their jobs. The\
  \ giant just imperceptibly undulated under the dead grannie. He needs something\
  \ better, something more daring. \n\nHe ran up to a police officer and loudly proclaimed,\
  \ \"I will kill people. I will kill people!\" No reaction. He unbuttoned his pants\
  \ and kicked him in the dick. No reaction. Unbuttoned the pistol holder and charged\
  \ up the pistol. \"I will kill. Myself!\" Nothing. \"I will kill as many people\
  \ as I can! Do something!\" The cop just stood there, blankly, and looked at Gre.\
  \ Hopeless. If the bullet have gone through his head like through jelly and then\
  \ the pistol limped like a dick, then it could be a dream, and then Gre would become\
  \ free. But the bullet did the deed and the imbecile cop fell to the ground with\
  \ that same blank expression; no ground anuses to be found. Gre needs something\
  \ bigger. \n\nOnwards through the terminal door, nuclear something something ornamented\
  \ with a security guard, \"I'm going to detonate one!\" Nothing. Bullet to a head.\
  \ Gre twitchingnly pressed a launch button, like a dopaminergic rat nest. If the\

  \ doing any location setting, as if it mattered what part of the city gets decimated\
  \ anyway. Arching cumshot right back in Gre's mouth, biting away a huge chunk of\

Hydraulics of pornography did not allow for implosion, for madness is just another SEO tag to optimize. While pumping his action shotgun Gre almost left through a slur, but then he remembered what he was doing and said it louder: "You like that, you little nigger?" His partner obeying the raisin-de-thre for this whole ordeal responded automatically, "yes daddy, you so thick!" Raisin. A little nugget of shit on Gre's dick. "This idiot didn't do the enema right."
