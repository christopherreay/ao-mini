  body: "Thanks for the share. I\u2019ll watch the video with interest.\n\n\u201C\
    Buddhist\u201D/Indian philosophy on Existence, or Epistemology is still refreshing\
    \ and insightful. Nagarjuna is a heavyweight on grasping these subjects. Find\
    \ him trippy to no end.\n\nI\u2019d take your McMindfulness a step further and\
    \ say that even what we get presented as Buddhist thought is so watered down (starting\
    \ with using such a broad label for a beautiful diversity of approaches) is at\
    \ time McBuddhismosophy. \n\n(Yes this is a non-performative comment, heavy on\
    \ casual talk, far from some SotS content, hope no one doesn\u2019t mind)."

    body: "Hope you find it interesting and useful. Yup I\u2019ve noticed similar\
      \ things about the ways Buddhism is presented to us moderns. You really need\
      \ to put yourself in the shoes of these Ancient Indians to get at what the philosophy\
      \ is pointing at, and understand the utility of the myriad approaches to it.\n\
      \nI figured it might jive with the sort of abstract modes of thinking that SotS\
      \ people know and love haha"

  body: Thanks for this. The really interesting aspect of this is the difference  between
    western and eastern cosmology. Tantra versus monotheism to me exposes the epistemologies
    at the heart of culture and in turn what is lacking. Epistemology is etiology/cosmogony/cosmology
    imo.

  body: Buddhism has a rich phenomenological tradition, and more broadly I sense a
    lot of overlap between Buddhism and quite a few western thinkers, but it's quite
    difficult to synthesize them in great depth due to a large chasm of differing
    terminology, approach, and general lack of discourse between east and west.

  I thought people in this sub might appreciate the kinds of cosmologies discussed
  in the meditative traditions that map out various dynamics that occur within the
  subjective experience, both at the individual and collective level. Ajahn Sona is
  a pretty serious Buddhist monk and conveys these ideas in a way that is palatable
  to modern sensibilities but doesn''t compromise on the rigor of what these frameworks
  are trying to convey. Quite different from the McMindfulness that is sold in the
  West in the form of meditation apps and corporate seminars haha. I''m sure a lot
  of these ideas could be applied to the social dynamics that are discussed in SotS.


  Buddhism definitely seems to penetrate aspects of the mind and human condition beyond
  the purview of psychoanalysis, as far as I can see.'
