  body: "Nothing too groundbreaking here, but Naydler talks about Steiner in a way\
    \ that reminded me of y'all.\n\nTopics discussed that I found relevant:\n\n- History\
    \ of consciousness and the birth of philosophy \n\n- Lucifer and Ahriman\n\n-\
    \ Confusing minds with machines\n\n\nAs an educator, I'm particularly interested\
    \ in Naydler's emphasis on educating children to use computers and technology\
    \ without loosing their identity as humans hearts and minds-- to be heroes instead\
    \ of automata.\n\nExisting in a technological society without directing the myth\
    \ of mechanistic determinism inward is a particular challenge.  \n\n*Edit: formatting "

  body: I've read a couple of his books and several of his pamphlet/essays. We exchanged
    several emails when I made the essay/pamphlet purchases from his publishing company.
    I really enjoy his perspective which is ironically pretty conservative. He is
    essentially insinuating cyclical time and high weirdness but he refuses to get
    into the whole preaching and antics of alt history conspiracy. It's a shame there
    isnt more recordings of him online. As far as I know that youtube clip is all
    there is.

    body: 'Can you recommend any of his works?  I''m thinking about order Plato, shamanism
      and Ancient Egypt.


      I wish he had more videos online.  I really enjoy his demeanor and way he articulates
      his ideas.'
