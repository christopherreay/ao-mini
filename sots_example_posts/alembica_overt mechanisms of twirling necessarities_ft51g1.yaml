overt mechanisms of twirling necessarities so far impossible to grasp for outside the constrictions of a tight shape) while depleting energy continuously from these mechanisms, and must seem extraordinary to those few who have not succeeded in reaching them.

The soul, as we have seen in the case of the Egyptians, as a locus of the perfect structures of cause and effect, is therefore effectively re-created in the highest (though less paradoxical) forms of monadic phenomena, and when the unconscious unity of the soul may thereby become relatively objective and consciously obtained as a binding power, as the self-consciousness of the Jedi in Yoda, it has been demonstrated that it will manifest in various configurations.

When you introduce cybernetics and the concept of radiance, the human body becomes transformed into the most phenomenal manifestation of pure neural radiation. Thus, as again in the case of the Egyptians, the spiritual human self gains another sacred dimension, that of radiant intensity that is found in art and that is essentially "more real" than any material manifestation

But this power of radiance is not to be confused with profundity; the personality and its core self, its animal and inorganic body, and the elements must be brought back to an equilibrium that harmonizes the whole being with its cosmic potential, just as for the ancient Egyptian, the fulfillment of the essential tasks of the body was contingent upon the wellbeing of the soul, and the soul's transformation was the work of the gods. In further contrast to the Egyptian philosophy, the bhakti approach assumes that the divine forms on the physical plane are not mechanical but organic and vital, and the interactions between the divine in the form of humans and the divine in the form of the divine animals will provide the creative impulse.

Hymns and statues with animal forms provide links with the primal ground of all things, as our own species was created from an animal body. Each animal is designed to give a divine 'service' to its owners. It is responsible for fertility and the presentation of spring. It is associated with reproduction and childbirth. It accompanies the Devi in her ceremonies, and has religious implications.

What is non human intelligence? What is human intelligence? Where does the observer end and the systems begin and what are the implications of paying attention? Who guards the door? What goes up, what comes down?

In the same way, the human being in its physical state, representing the highest form of intelligence, protects the door, but this gatekeeper intelligence has an extreme of self-limiting power which is dependent upon the consciousness of the people; this gatekeeper intelligence will always want to have back for its benefit whatever she knows, and the rest depends on the consciousness of the people. What happens to the best of humanity under the pressure of the circumstances is not meant to be looked at in an absolute manner.

 Is a person able to preserve his intent in an emergency of disasters of any kind or when his energies are not in the right condition? Is the person able to discern the right avenue for traffic through a narrow lane?
