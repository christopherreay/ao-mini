    body: 'I''m calling it, the post and the question are a LARP. Sometimes, people
      seem to want to be spectacle, not expose it. It''s probably gratifying for some,
      when others fall for it. Maybe they want to show they understand it, by low
      key mocking, instead of high key critique.


      It''s hard to be serious all the time. I''m not saying people shouldn''t do
      this.'

pandemic capitalism hit sorcery of the spectacle – so much so, in fact, that a propaganda film made it into my 10-year-old years; something about the Polynesian taboo against curses or "spirits" trying to communicate with one another.

We who claim to be members of the pagan circle circle, however, don't really think much of that particular theoretical dynamic, since we see we've found our answer – but for a totally different reason. With Cthulhu – who has now taken his place in our pantheon – is there any reasonable way to treat him? Is he really human? Or does he represent the most horrific and blasphemous form of the beast that is science? Or perhaps, the apotheosis of all things inhuman
