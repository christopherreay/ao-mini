I did it. I infiltrated sorcery of the spectacle and injected dangerous alt right rhetoric into the rhizome of alternative culture.

 Never before has a case such as this been successfully thwarted by groups of reactionary "journalists" seeking to project the behavior of the lunatic fringe onto what they assumed was a movement of normies. It was clear from the beginning that the imagery of skulls and crossbones would have to be delivered within the framework of contemporary white supremacy. 

The relevant philosophy is represented in the dogma of classical Marxism: the world was divided into a basic class which represents labor (the proletariat) and a low, dark, and dispossessed part which has the means of existence through wage labor (the bourgeoisie). This division is presented as something necessarily natural and unavoidable, some result of natural evolutionary processes, which must be transcended through progress. It is a fatalistic idea; we must accept it as the cosmic law.

 The proletariat is constantly asphyxiated by capitalism and seeks only to feed off the profit of others; we must thus embrace working for the common good, to liberate humanity from self-centredness and to purify it by love of humanity and by hope. This does not contradict the state, the rich, the proletariat or capital. But this division was imposed by mankind into the first world, and the proletariat rejects it with hatred and blows.
