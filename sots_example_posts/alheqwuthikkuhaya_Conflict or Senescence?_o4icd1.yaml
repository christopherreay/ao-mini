    life?


    all of it. every single strand of human history comes from our desire to run from
    death, to avoid being forgotten. but can you blame them? and isnt this just conflict
    against time?'

  body: 'The doctrine that "all is war" is the inevitable consequence of substance
    metaphysics - a metaphysics that is based on the permanent and the unchanging
    ultimately prescribes the desire to be permanent and unchanging (eternally significant.)
    x=x is a statement of war against *not x,* the unaccounted factors that risk x
    losing its essential x-ness via the influence of another.


    Start with change as your metaphysical principle, and you''ll find quite different
    implications. A metaphysics that embraces self-transformation as desirable is
    an evolutionary metaphysics, and finds (if it is able to manage) a mode of relating
    with the world that can only be described as living poetry, or a romance with
    the universe. The feeling is that of a dance.


    The mystery opens with the question of the metaphysical implications of the fundamental
    theorem of calculus - the relationship between integration and differentiation
    as inverse operations of the same process. What grows from it is a view of life
    that is at once intimately familiar and surprisingly refreshing, as if [the very
    elements of creative alchemy are being apprehended in their purest form.](https://vimeo.com/563950668)


    >After all, about the only thing we can really say about life is that it ends.


    Everything you say is about life, because it is said from the perspective of a
    life. Indeed it is impossible to not talk about life.


    Read "This View of Life" by David Sloan Wilson for an introduction to evolutionary
    thought imagined in the proper expansiveness of its domain.'

selftext: 'Conflict is a simple metaphysical theory of everything. Marx talked about
  it as the basis for history. The Italian elitists, even that ever-present opponent
  of Marxism Pareto, did not fundamentally disagree with this and only stipulated
  that the conflict was mostly between feuding oligarchs and aristocrats rather than
  (necessarily being between) broad classes. Nash set up a huge mathematical overture
  about games, which inherently involve winners and losers, even the single player
  variants (it is concerning to some people when they find out that he was active
  primarily in economics). Burroughs put it as:


  >This is a war universe. War all the time. That is its nature. There may be other
  universes based on all sorts of other principles, but ours seems to be based on
  war and games. All games are basically  hostile. Winners and losers. We see them
  all around us: the winners and the losers. The losers can oftentimes become winners,
  and the winners can very easily become losers.


  And of course everything Cormac McCarthy ever wrote is enamored with this. Agents
  deal in contention because resources are scarce, and contention produces conflict,
  and conflict makes competition. So what else is there?


  There are now places where resources are effectively unlimited. The obvious one
  is the internet. Communities are not exactly restricted anymore in terms of space,
  there is no limit except for attention, but in any given community someone who doesn''t
  like how one is run can find a new space to exist in pretty easily. The libertarian
  space exploration fantasy (as practiced and believed by Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, etc)
  takes this idea to the stars, and hopes to eliminate conflict by eliminating scarcity.
  Marx put it better some hundreds of years ago, but the idea is the same. The end
  of history will come when no one wants for anything.


  Plenty of objections to this exist. Perhaps desires are irrational and can never
  be satisfied. Perhaps the desire to subjugate is something everyone feels. But the
  one that gets me lately is the fact that even peaceful communities, including those
  of cells that make up people, can eventually dissolve by the result of mistakes
  and complexity piling up over time. Some arthropods can live theoretically forever,

  through, unable to crest this new hill. The same is true of cancer. Noise accumulates
  as a result of simple copying, and eventually these unkillable cells kill their
  own kind. Gears grind each other into dust in the process of cooperation, fabric
  comes undone.
