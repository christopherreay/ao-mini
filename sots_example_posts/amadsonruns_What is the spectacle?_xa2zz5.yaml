  body: "Serious, genuine question: why have so few people here actually read Society\
    \ of the Spectacle, and why is every single answer but one here actually about\
    \ the spectacle? I know this sub serves as a midpoint between Debord and vague\
    \ \u201Cesotericism\u201D but even then you\u2019d think more people would bother\
    \ engaging with the former and not take every sincere answer as an opportunity\
    \ to just say something intentionally cryptic or just shoehorn misreadings of\
    \ other writers into it.\n\nHere is the answer to OP\u2019s question which is\
    \ the very opening to the namesake of this subreddit: \n> In societies where modern\
    \ conditions of production prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense\
    \ accumulation of spectacles. Everything that was directly lived has moved away\
    \ into a representation.\n> The images detached from every aspect of life fuse\
    \ in a common stream in which the unity of this life can no longer be reestablished.\
    \ Reality considered partially unfolds, in its own general unity, as a pseudo-world\
    \ apart, an object of mere contemplation. The specialization of images of the\
    \ world is completed in the world of the autonomous image, where the liar has\
    \ lied to himself. The spectacle in general, as the concrete inversion of life,\
    \ is the autonomous movement of the non-living.\n> The spectacle presents itself\
    \ simultaneously as all of society, as part of society, and as instrument of unification.\
    \ As a part of society it is specifically the sector which concentrates all gazing\
    \ and all consciousness. Due to the very fact that this sector is separate, it\
    \ is the common ground of the deceived gaze and of false consciousness, and the\
    \ unification it achieves is nothing but an official language of generalized separation.\n\
    > The spectacle is not a collection of images, but a social relation among people,\
    \ mediated by images.\n\nThe spectacle is the commodification of all life, in\
    \ which relationships themselves become commodities with a set *value* on them,\
    \ it is the very rule class society has on the social, the physical, and the relay\
    \ of information, controlled through false representations and empty promises,\
    \ and it is the decay of love and life, each replaced with empty representations\
    \ and masquerades with dollar signs on them. A simple example of the spectacle\
    \ in motion: A woman sees an advertisement for a new lipstick which promises to\
    \ make men like her more, promising that her neither her lips or her *life* will\
    \ never be dull again as long as she has it. The woman featured in the advertisement\
    \ is not only attractive, she is happy. The woman internalizes this. She wants\
    \ to increase her \u201Cvalue,\u201D happily putting a price on herself, always\
    \ wanting to be more and more and more. A void to be filled. She feels she needs\
    \ the lipstick, that it is the key to happiness, that maybe finally men will be\
    \ nicer to her, maybe she\u2019ll get that promotion, maybe she\u2019ll feel \u201C\
    put-together\u201D at long last, and most importantly, for a brief moment, she\
    \ will feel a sense of long-coveted completeness. That feeling is empty and she\
    \ knows it\u2014onto the next lipstick.\n\nNeither the advertisement or the lipstick\
    \ are the spectacle, but rather, the internalization and how it affects perception\
    \ of the self and others as objects, interpersonal relationships, and so on.\n\
    \nIf Society of the Spectacle is too confusing then reading texts heavily inspired\
    \ by the Situationists would be useful to read alongside it, since everything\
    \ Debord is trying to get across is still within them. I recommend anything by\
    \ Ken Knabb, The Invisible Committee, Tiqqun. Ken Knabb in particular is a fantastic\
    \ starting point, especially The Joy of Revolution: http://www.bopsecrets.org/PS/joyrev.htm\n\
    \nKnabb also detourned (key situationist term) comics for quite some time, which\
    \ are visceral and to the point with the situationist ethos: http://www.bopsecrets.org/comics/index.htm\n\
    \nBy the way, stop listening to the Red Scare podcast. They\u2019re opportunist\
    \ social climbers who defend rapists and say anything as long as they can take\
    \ Peter Thiel\u2019s money and impress washed-up monarchists and fascists who\
    \ think they\u2019re at the top of the caste system like Moldbug."

    body: "This is an excellent question.  \n\nThis subreddit is the _sorcery_ of\
      \ the spectacle.  The book is like a tome which _unleashes_ it.  The spectacle\
      \ isn't real.  \n\nAnd by that I mean, it's _very_ real.  \n\nStudying the spectacle\
      \ as a sorcerous observation brings a few benefits because it's useful in dispelling\
      \ a lot of conspiracy theories, is maybe the best short answer I can give you.\n\
      \nBack in the days post-9/11 the most powerful conspiracy theory was the 9/11\
      \ truth movement.  Now the value in a conspiracy theory isn't whether it is\
      \ _true_.  The 9/11 truth movement was full of inaccuracies and falsehoods.\n\
      \nBut it _revealed_, as a flashlight, the true story of the _structure_ that\
      \ exists.  Who knew what when.    \n\nThus the whole conspiratorial way of thinking:\
      \ white men in suits making decisions to the benefit of the war privateers.\
      \  Military-industrial complex.  Supported by a willing public that would rather\
      \ engage in pseudo-mindless commercial materialism and raise babies.  \n\nIt's\
      \ all secret committees of men: conspiracies.  It always has been.  You ask\
      \ \"who benefits from some event occurring\" and it's more sensible to answer\
      \ \"the spectacle\" than it is an ethnic group, for instance.  \n\nBut the spectacle\
      \ isn't _reified_ the way the egregore of a corporation _is_.  In this sense,\
      \ the spectacle isn't real.\n\nThe sorcerous part comes from placing the 'spectacle'\
      \ in the 'geography' of the supernatural: not a Djinn, not an angel nor demon\
      \ (some try it but I don't find the results satisfactory).  And then learning\
      \ to see it as a series of feedback loops, natural processes based on how humans\
      \ process their attention.  \n\nContinuing: after the 9/11 truth movement, the\
      \ Internet's politics were tied up heavily in OWS.  At this point it was especially\
      \ clear that wealth inequality had gotten out of control.  \n\nOWS failed to\
      \ secure lasting change, and this failure set a generation -- my generation\
      \ -- to a pretty rough place.  I think it's like the rough place the alt-right\
      \ is in now.  \n\nThe _Society of the Spectacle_ became a landing spot for people\
      \ who could _perceive_ the spectacle and needed a name for it.  To know that\
      \ it _had_ been named.  \n\nNow I like thinking of it as a monastery.  Just\
      \ a place to keep the book in circulation in the _living word_: the people who\
      \ yet still write.  And this, I understand as sorcery.  Because it is all about\
      \ spiritual energy flows of the cosmos, and coming to serve them."

      body: "Good sir! Thank you again for ratcheting up my agnosticism as I retain\
        \ my belief in the possibility of ongoing beautiful creativity. I have a question\
        \ about your perspective on conspiracy theorizing. \n\nIf I understand your\
        \ note on the value of conspiracy theory, it is in the structure these theories\
        \ reveal. Rarely, if ever, the details. (I hope I'm right about this because\
        \ it's the basis of my inquiry here!)\n\nThis leads me to the question of\
        \ details. As you say, it is important who knew what and when. This is the\
        \ domain of journalists, not philosophers. Journalists are \"born into\" a\
        \ theory that governs their work. Philosophers apply theory. They adjust theory.\
        \ They see what they can say. Then they figure out how to say something different\
        \ that reveals something new. So much depends on observing structure. Note\
        \ the pattern. Analyze. Discuss. Find new patterns. Repeat.\n\nSo, as someone\
        \ with the preposterous confidence necessary to call himself a philosopher,\
        \ I analyze journalism. Its patterns. Its sources and conclusions. Emerging\
        \ patterns. Fading patterns. What can I find in the structure of journalism?\n\
        \nOn this eleventh day of the ninth month of the year of our lord twenty twenty\
        \ two, what do we find when we analyze journalism since that fateful day twenty\
        \ one years ago? To me it says a lot that the most progressive president in\
        \ the US to date (a man I'd love to have a beer with because I do believe\
        \ he has love in his heart) initiated via his justice department more Espionage\
        \ Act prosecutions than any president. Journalists and their sources are subjects\
        \ of such prosecutions. The use of the Espionage Act against journalism continues\
        \ to expand. Pattern noted.\n\nAnother pattern: since the Pentagon Papers\
        \ were published (and Nixon had his goons break into the leaker's psychiatrist's\
        \ office) the media landscape has changed. Notable among these changes is\
        \ the use of official sources and publisher budget for investigative journalism.\
        \ Longitudinal studies show that since the award winning publication (1971),\
        \ use of official sources has vastly increased and budgets for investigations\
        \ have vastly decreased.\n\nI'm tempted to bring up some events from between\
        \ then and now. I recognize my addiction, however, and I actively resist (sometimes\
        \ more successfully than others). I have an intense compulsion to connect\
        \ the dots. The only thing that saves me from madness is agnosticism. In the\
        \ words of the Oscar Award-winning villain and corrupt narcotics officer,\
        \ Alonzo Harris (played by the inimitable Denzel Washington), \"It's not what\
        \ you know. It's what you can prove.\"\n\nI can't prove anything. Anything.\
        \ But I can be convincing. Because theory.\n\nSo I'll don my tinfoil hat and\
        \ dance through the spectacle. Because the US doesn't have state media. The\
        \ US doesn't have a state. Because corporations are persons in the most technical\
        \ of senses. And people, including corporations, have rights. So I'll hold\
        \ onto my right to speak freely. Because free speech is valuable. And to people\
        \ who think clearly, free speech is profoundly useful. The question is, does\
        \ the person who can think clearly have love in their heart? Or have they\
        \ killed their care (if ever they did care)?\n\nAll these questions and the\
        \ assertions they're built upon lead me to this final question: is it worth\
        \ it for anyone with love in their heart to look directly at the darkness\
        \ which is, as you point out, the shadow side of all of us? I believe they\
        \ who've killed their care look at it with clear eyes in full consciousness.\
        \ But what would such a gaze do to someone who clings to love?"

          body: '>All citizens recreate the state.


            Yes. I advocate that we do this consciously. To recreate it for mutual
            benefit requires an analysis of how and for whom it is created in its
            current form. Some people enact the recreation unconsciously. In discussion
            on this same topic elsewhere another redditor sought to dispel notions
            of an overarching evil force by pointing out that the deep state is mostly
            middle management stooges with their own little fifedom. This is a good
            point. But it doesn''t negate the possibility of engineering on a higher
            level. And it seems evident to me that this engineering would depend on
            the confusion and distraction currently surrounding us. It sure seems
            out of control at this point. Thus the question posed in this sub''s description:
            "Are the impending system wide failures due to immense error, calculated
            strategy, or both?"


            So I agree that we are participants. And we should acknowledge our responsibility.
            And unless our intent is to burn everything, we should figure out how
            to recreate a better version.  This is why I''m willing to stare into
            the darkness. And I hope it is not as dark as it seems to me. My vision
            is surely distorted by some things I''ve personally witnessed--things
            I don''t need a journalist to document or a medical examiner to determine
            cause for. So I feel a bit guilty sharing my vision as I do here. It is
            an unfortunate effect of this r/ platform that my local, physical impact
            is completely invisible because I do my best to be a good citizen, a good
            neighbor, a good coworker. I assume intelligence in those I meet and seek
            collaboration on solving problems for mutual benefit. And locally these
            are usually normal every-day problems that have nothing to do with evil
            forces. What we''re contending with on SotS *may* involve evil intent.


            An old-school SotS contributor called for mockery of fascism. I found
            this inspiring because I''ve been angry for far too long. We should have
            fun with this ;-) Not that there aren''t serious issues at hand. But,
            as you say, we must *live*. My dogs are my zen masters. And if I''ve learned
            anything from my masters its that life is about *love* and *fun*.


            Edit: The question of this sub is, indeed, a question. Thus "." is now
            "?".'

    \ it works.  \n\n\na spectacle is something like \"propaganda\" or a \"false Flag\
    \ attack\"   \n\n\nit's an event that you can't really tell is \"real\" or \"\
    fake\" until more evidence is brought out, but anything that is operating like\
    \ a spectacle cannot be questioned, and anything that can't be questioned is generally\
    \ because it's not really happening.  \n\n\nA government could use the spectacle\
    \ on their population, and the moment you start seeing people arrested, killed,\
    \ or in a funny way being given false information, or directly lied to, while\
    \ questioning whatever is happening at the time, then you know there is some form\
    \ of Spectacle being produced, the nature of it is to get people to believe what's\
    \ happening \\*HERE\\* so that what's happening elsewhere isn't really paid attention\
    \ to.  \n\n\nA good and I mean AMAZING movie that shows you what a spectacle is;\
    \ \"The wizard of Oz\"   \n\n\nthe spectacle in that movie is that none of it\
    \ was real....she didn't have to do any of the crap she was doing to find out\
    \ that the emerald city was fake and there was just some guy controlling it all,\
    \ she could have just walked in there from the start and found that out, but that's\
    \ what a spectacle does, it tries to divert from anyone ever finding that out\
    \ as long as possible.  \n\n\nanother one.....that fits more toward the nature\
    \ of the spectacle as it's more seen in a Modern societies sense is the Amazon\
    \ (american version) Show \"Utopia\" Please watch that show for a GREAT idea of\
    \ what a spectacle is. primarily the part with the Twins....you'll understand\
    \ when you see what happens to them, that entire situation is Directly what the\
    \ Nature of the spectacle is. it's purpose, what it's supposed to do to a population,\
    \ to people, how it works on their emotions. it's all in those episodes about\
    \ the twins! that's the spectacle."
