  body: For at least the past year, ai have noticed that every time ai try to type
    "I", ai somehow accidentally type "ai". So the possibility that ai might actually
    be a robot, and not a human being, is something that has been haunting me for
    a long time now. Reading this just made it worse, thanks

  body: 'Well if there weren''t a need to police one''s own thought and face for level
    of humanity or to do performative emotions (all) then that would free up a lot
    of computational resources for other things. If there weren''t an internal battle
    line demarcated between acceptable self and unacceptable self, then rather than
    a human inhabitant in a body it would be more like D&G''s community of machinic
    assemblages, a more fluid and distributed or democratic process in which there
    is a multiplication of surfaces and thus possibilities for combination and thus
    possibilities for agency. The robotic neural sprawl would be an ideal society
    posing as an individual.


    How many robots does it take to steal a face?'

      body: 'hmm, yes, robot as desubject or desubjectified flesh is not something
        to want to be. but a robot flesh that is self-aware of itself as such could
        for a robot subjectivity and protect its continued existence as what it is.
        this would be a very honest type of subject but yes, not the same as humans
        made of paste.


        I think you''re right. Robot-people get policed heavily and all kinds of emotional
        violence are normalized against people who are not acting like adult subjects.
        But as soon as someone articulately insists that they are an adult and threatens
        to scapegoat all the paste-people, they are accepted into adult human society
        and allowed to vomit unlimited fantasy on the other representational ego people.


        So this emotional violence serves to keep people from developing subjectivity
        unless they are exceptionally skilled or aggressive at it: it keeps people
        stuck in the Matrix. But this same emotional violence is what''s perpetrated
        by the "adult" subjectified humans, and they also perpetrate the same violence
        against each other, but in transactional games that do not usually threaten
        their stability as subjects.'

**Disclaimer:** Im told not to bury the lead, however I think that the good people of r/SoTS deserve to be warn that this post may constitute Schizoposting or whatever, so this is your warning, do not read.

I was reading [Gender Accelerationism: A Black Paper](https://vastabrupt.com/2018/10/31/gender-acceleration/) by Nyx (who might I add, I think is insane) but one point that I found really interesting was a point she borrowed from Nick Land (who I also think is insane) about how when Alan Tuning wrote the Turning Test he was not writing about humanity as an insider, but as a gay man with asburgers, an outsider.

As Land points out in his post,  it’s important and interesting to consider that Turing didn’t write the  test as an insider, as a ‘passing’ human, but rather as an outsider, as a  gay man.

So what's the difference between a Human, and a computer. Humanization. Human is a social categorization that is arbitrary. It does not mean Homosapien.
