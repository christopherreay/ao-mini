      Relationships. Relational ontology is the future, it is a language of interpretation
      and description that will allow for the expression of deep authentic intimacy
      between us and many aspects of the world. It will allow for the clarification
      and social amplification of transformative virtues. It is a meta-meta-narrative
      and it is about "the nature of perspectival change" and epistemological evolution.
      It is in one aspect about "the educational process" in the most general sense.
      What this meta-narrative anticipates is a social movement of mass mutual education
      that grows from relationships involving mutual education creating vectors for
      additional mutual education. At the core of this movement would be communities
      of individuals who have learned how to learn from each other very well: democratized
      invisible colleges.'

        What is there, or what will come, that will mediate deeper connections and

        I mean I would posit a kind of metaphysical ethnolinguistic worldview could
        fulfill this quoata, but that usually draws accusations of ignorance and hate
        and all the bad things.


        But set aside the baggage associated with all the loaded terms surrounding
        this idea, and it would seem to fit your idea of relational ontology quite
        nice.'

### A Lack of Deeper Connection among Human Species is at All time High

The modern societies with their impaired values and broken social  structures are increasingly making it difficult for human beings to  connect with each other. The rampant individualistic and  hyper-materialistic culture across the world is adding up to relational  poverty. Human beings thereby are smothering their innate, natural  propensity of empathizing, and bonding with each other.

### Relational poverty is worse than economic or any other forms of poverty

Relational poverty is a modern form of penury resulting from the  decline of social capital in society. The phenomenon of Relational  poverty is nothing but a side-effect of the [‘Genie of Privacy’](http://www.ananddamani.com/blog/height-of-marketing-how-loneliness-became-privacy/)  practiced and promoted by materialists. It is affecting the human  population at large, regardless of race, gender, age, or socioeconomic  status.

People nowadays have friends and followers over the internet in  thousands and even millions. However, they have only a handful of real  friends to establish a real emotional bond with. Human relationships  have turned void and fragile. They have ceased to be a source of  fulfilment.

In reality, human beings are social beings, programmed to share  feelings and build fulfilling relations with other human beings and  nature. This is what makes them the most evolved species on the planet.  As the most evolved species, human beings are supposed to love and be  affectionate with each other.
