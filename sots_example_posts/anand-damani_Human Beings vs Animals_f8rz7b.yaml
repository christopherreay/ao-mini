      Source??? Surprised to see this evo-psych objective-instrumental rationality
      here. What makes the truths of evolution to explain human behaviour the only
      objective truths as opposed to aesthetical, theological, metaphysical truths
      etc, etc.?'

        Perhaps you misunderstood - it was not to say that evolutionary, objective-instrumental

        ignore our evolutionary history''s contribution to our behaviors and attributes
        is to deprive ourselves of one particularly useful lens for self-understanding.'

  body: 'Not even disagreeing with anyone per se, but I''ve had a thought recently
    regarding the benefits of viewing humans as animals (which we are, although I
    agree that we are of a different sort, mainly due to our hands and upright walking
    imo, although the brain plays a huge role as well of course).


    Anyway, I see viewing humans as animals as a good thing (of course I''ve found
    animals critically misunderstood in terms of their depth of communication and
    intelligence). But it always gives me a chuckle when \*some\* vegans (this is
    obviously quite the generalization) attempt to remove animal suffering from their
    chain of consumption without any regard for human labor/suffering. Some of us
    seem to have developed a kind of loathing for humans by not viewing them as animals,
    being less willing to forgive human shortcomings that are also shortcomings found
    in nature, or more precisely being more willing to essentially posit that the
    cruelty of humans exempts us from the spiritual value we assign to animals (and
    yet others likewise harbor a sort of contempt for animals, an opposite reaction
    from similar first premises). I.e. we have done so much harm to animals, we don''t
    need to be saved, or are somehow too "alien" to this world to live in harmony
    with it.


    So I suppose for me the problem is more clearly defined not as a failure to either
    accept or reject our animal nature, but rather a failure to properly integrate
    it.


    Now, I can admittedly at least see the argument that, for instance, our tools
    and capacity for destruction have become too heavy for this planet to bear. But
    at the same time, I do sort of feel that if we actually incorporated humans and
    animals both into the chain of suffering we cause, such that vegans would dedicate
    equal work to protecting and uplifting lithium miners as we do animals, refusing
    to allow animal and human exploitation in equal measure, that the products we
    made with out brilliant brains and hands would be enormously less destructive.  There
    would be no shame in our animal nature, nor in our human capacity to collectively
    reject allowing ourselves to resign to the chain of exploitation. We would be
    able to reach for the stars, without beginning to assume that one person''s goals
    make them "better" than others, especially if those goals come from immense exploitation.
    The beautiful diversity of nature would be a reminder of this...I think humans
    often give lip service to the power of embracing diversity, but sometimes forget
    how true this really is.'

  body: 'I don''t understand this sentence: "Applying animal specific use cases to

    This assumes that our immaterial minds could have evolved from material beings,
    which there are strong philosophical reasons to deny and which Alfred Russel Wallace,
    one of the founders of evolutionary theory, also denied: "Animals are a prerequisite
    for human evolution and that purpose has been achieved."   Let''s face it:  scientists
    need to stop treating Darwin like God and his theory as a pan-aitia; then again
    modern biologists also assume certain problematic principles from modern philosophers
    like Hume who influenced Darwin.


    This is true: "Now human beings need to understand what is human behavior and
    it cannot be understood solely on the basis of animal behavior."  Might I suggest
    reading Aquinas''s Treatise on Human Action?  Best thing ever written on the subject.


    Your initial post seems more like a comment, that''s partly incoherent, than a
    genuine question.  For animal behavior I suggest reading Wynne''s book on animal
    cognition.'

Human beings and animals are different species. Applying animal specific use cases to human beings have done a lot of damage to human thoughts.   


Animals are a prerequisite for human evolution and that purpose has been achieved.  Now human beings need to understand what is human behavior and it cannot be understood solely on the basis of animal behavior.
