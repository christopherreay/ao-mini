      No body can own anything in reality.You just coexist with all other material
      and the material can only change form neither can be created nor destroyed.


      If something is complementary and useful then using it in a way it is sustainable

        body: 'The money symbolises material things. And a human being has needs that
          are not material but based on relationship. Say for eg trust, love, belonging
          are what a human being needs over and above the material needs.


          It is understanding this reality that will help human beings to  understand
          the utility and limitation of Money or value behind the money.


          Human being is a union of the physical body and the soul/life atom and both
          have independent  needs.Without the body the soul can not experience reality
          or understand the relationships . Without the soul the body is useless.
          So they are complementing and coexist. The needs of the soul are above the
          needs of the body. A soul can order the body to blow himself to pieces in
          suicidal bombings or the plane crash of 9/11. This is the reality which
          if we understand then we know to value the use of Money as only for the
          material stuff .

        He feels is satisfying when he gives some one more than what he receives.

        Understand the relationship with others and instead of trying to make some
        one loose to win always try to produce more and share.


        This can be discussed in detail and thread bare about how it is practically
        possible in society.


        Humane behavior and understanding can make it possible. We will not donate
        or shame or have any individual feel insulted but give everyone an opportunity
        to be needed and productive. The universe has enough opportunities and it
        will be there if one human does not deprive another human being,'

            A group of such families living happily each contributing and enriching
            the earth is what will attract the attention of others.

            That will be the proof.

            One Family started it in Amrkanthak in India and the ffect is atleast
            a 1000 famllies trying to live this way.

            Now there are a group of families in Calgary Canada living this way and
            modifying the thinking of a dozen families in Europe who are staying with
            them.

            I can share teh full roadmap for utopia to be executed. Human race thanks
            to the Trumps, Modis,JIn Pings can blow themselves out of the world before
            that happens is  a possibility.

            Greta  a small girl from Sweden is fighting for Humanity. We can support
            her or logically debate and prove our point.

            The beauty is the human construct and how he can look at things in infinite
            ways.

            i think it does exist, as i described.it's just the basic consequences
            of using the concept of profit in distributing "energy", it's clunky and
            got "sadness" embedded in it. how many angels can dance on the tip of
            a pin = that kind of method to spot, name and tag every infinestimal unit
            of such sadness... but that is just as damage control and for the eventual
            reparation , when everything will have it's day in court.

              body: we are posting in sorceryofthespectacle, bizarre methods are ok.  and  the
                reparation thing is inspired from  philosophy, badiou.  i used the
                angels image as a metaphor and possibly transferrable conceptual framework
                to analyze the object i am chasing, intellectual recycling, but it
                might not be worth the bother, something new might be better suited.  figuring
                out the existence of that abstract negativity can be useful to address
                real tangible negative effect in the environment  , worker's longevity/health/happiness
                and so on.  i have other ideas about this, to flesh it out  in a deeper
                way, nietzschean way,  but i guess it will have to be later or in
                another thread.

    I think you might find the term "social reality" useful. It refers to social pressure
    that forces majority of people to behave as if it is real.


    E.g. you can choose not to buy a ring for your partner, but that most likely mean
    you will not be able to convince her to get married with you.

  body: The next best and free avenue is exchanging service and skill. The only issue
    I see with that is it still provides the same issues you would find in any competitive
    economy. Even worse, checks and balances would not be as readily available for
    safety and security purposes leaving it quite easy to take competition out in
    a market that favors exchange of service. You leave yourself open to vulnerability
    and to requiring a certain level of trust and honor amongst the free. Money, while
    representing a "fake" image of exchanged paper still acts as placeholder and policy
    maker. Money is a smaller contract than the larger ones used for consigned works.
    It does, unfortunately, make the world go round. Those who have it do, fortunately,
    help others when needed or warranted. The resources are placed where necessary...
    though often justice is nonexistent and the resources aren't placed exactly where
    they should be with importance being placed on image and comfort over necessity
    and infrastructure. I do not think it is necessarily that people in power wish
    to have luxuriant circumstances over providing for need so much as there is a
    wall between reality and perception thereof. So many people and signatures go
    into planning events for all purposes that certain items get lost in the mix.
    This is not to ignore those who DO take advantages where they certainly should
    not for the sake of luxuriating. But we assume much and we know little of the
    facts. Tl;dr I'm a dumdum, I know nothing,

  body: 'The fault is on those that are led to believe that they own their money.
    Money is as much a product as the newest AyePhoon is. In fact it costs less to
    make money than to manufacture one of those. So for your sake, invest your money
    in something with actual value, or better yet something that makes tangible goods.


    Whenever you are dealing with or in money, you are circulating someone elses values
    and making them have value, a ''value'' that they would not have if "you/society"
    didnt move them around.


    For a better picture, imagine that instead of money, we traded in baseball cards
    or Barceylona FC cards. The royalities going to the team owning the cards that
    everyone is trading in would add up over time to where those sports teams can
    buy countries or continents (given enough scourging time)'

      The real stuff is what that has value. And that value is only when it is consumed.You

      telling you only make enough bread for you to eat.


      There will always be enough for you tomorrow thanks to Nature. Human beings
      can not surpass nature and prevent someone from enjoying the bounties of Nature.
      In trying to do that all society has failed.


      A new form of society where every one is self regulated and there is no control
      is what could be ideal. The path to that is education of the existence reality.

    \nMoney existed during periods of anti-consumerism and consumerism-lite. 18th\

    body: 'A very Beautiful poem.

      INFLATION is a mental construct that has been given by economists to ruin the
      planet.

      The sum total of all wealth in the earth (Material world ) can never be increased
      or decreased.The form can change but it will still be matter.

      The beautiful thoughts relationships and memories are what human beings can
      multiply by living in the human way.

      You have a great gift of writing beautiful Poetry.

      Please pick my articles any of your choice make poems out of the same and publish

In  the present, all the intellectual minds are absorbed in producing money. All the system of employment and business functions tirelessly to create money.

In the absence of an object, the banknotes are useless. Banknotes are just pieces of paper with legal prints that validate them in the system.
