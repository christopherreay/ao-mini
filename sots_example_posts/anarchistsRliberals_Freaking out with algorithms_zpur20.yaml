  body: "I'm a Swedish person. \n\nThe youtube algoritm suggest me a American black\
    \ woman  that's obviously  in some kind of weird psychosis or something. \n\n\
    She posts like 10 videos a day that's 10 minutes long with titles like \"narcissism\"\
    \ and talks a bunch of stuff that's totally impossible to understand into a shitty\
    \ microphone. \n\nThe videos has like 0-2 views and she sometimes live-streams\
    \ and the time I have watched  it  had  1 viewer, idk if that means its only me.\
    \ \n\nSo far I have clicked on her like 3 times. But she keeps coming up into\
    \ my recommendations almost everyday. \n\nAnd It feels eerie. Especially because\
    \ I'm a person that most definitely would dig deeper if I just was a bit more\
    \ bored. But how the fuck did the algoritm assign this 0 viewer girl to me."

Never cared much about some of the drama, I just enjoyed my TikTok 'for you page' watching whatever the algo thinks is good for me

It's been a nice ride, much fun, lots of family guy episodes, sketchy gender positions, c-level memes about tasting biscuits, reddit posts read by cheezy robotic voices

It's been so fun that I actively told people they should try it out, the algo is really smart and find good stuff for you

Then yesterday, after watching a tok about communication in relationships and another recommendation for music -Andy Shauf - The Party- there was this weird one. A person was talking about being chemically and physically castrated and know they were slaves to big pharma. What struck me as odd was #tedkaczynski, and before I knew, the video faded to a mug shot of the Unabomber

I didn't think much of it, there's a lot of shit content that I consume, but I took a screenshot and dropped my fone

Later that evening I picked it up again, good videos, fun videos, until a short weird meme made me question everything I was doing

It was a male dancing to [Angel of Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJL0FmreiUw) doing the anime choreography saying that he wished he was trans because femcel ideology is better than incel ideology

Why was the algo trying to radicalize me into those things? 

I closed my account and uninstalled the app from my cellphone feeling I would never me safe anymore
