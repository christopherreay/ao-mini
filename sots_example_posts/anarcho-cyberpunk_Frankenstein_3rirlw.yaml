    body: 'Her father was William Godwin, arguably the first anarchist in the modern
      sense. Her mother was famously an outspoken feminist. Her husband was also a
      proponent of anarchism, and the book itself can be read as feminist and anarchist.


      Also, her infant daughter died and she became briefly obsessed with raising
      the dead, no doubt part of the inspiration for the story.


      Beyond that, having read Paradise Lost will add quite a bit to the story, but
      it''s not essential.


      I would recommend reading the Wikipedia article on Prometheus before you start,
      and being open to the story on a literal level, and allegorical level, and possibly
      even as an occult text.


      Anyway, have fun, and *please* let me know if you enjoy it!'

selftext: 'I think everyone should read this book. It has so many layers of symbolism
  and explores the way society shapes both oppressor and oppressed in ways that are
  ultimately no good for anyone. Though the book came from before the time we usually
  think of as containing "the spectacle," the liberatory effect this book had on me
  cannot be overstated, and there seems to be some kind of occult level to it as well.
  By this I don''t only mean the religious allusions, but also a kind of equivalence
  between the writer, protagonist, monster, and Prometheus. The book represents, to
  me, a burning not brought from the gods but from the dispossessed, brought to burn
  the old social conventions that fragment us all, making us into piecemeal walking
  corpses, ashamed and afraid of what we really are.


  I don''t have the words to describe this book other than to say, just read it. For
  your own sake. And for everyone else''s.'
