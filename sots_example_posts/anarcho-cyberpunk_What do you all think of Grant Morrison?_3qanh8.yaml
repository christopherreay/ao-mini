  body: 'I think he is less interesting than his main rival, Alan Moore, both in terms
    of his relationship with the spectacle (Moore being an active practitioner of
    psychogeography via his friendship with Iain Sinclair) and magic (where I find
    Moore''s work much more insightful and provocative). But I am a big fan all the
    same, and have written (and continue to write) extensively on both men''s work.


    I suspect The Invisibles would be rather more to most people here''s taste and
    interests than Supergods.'

      Anything you can recommend I read about Moore?'

        body: 'Great comic that one. Visually stunning and utterly absorbing. I recall
          that at one stage every volume was a mindmap that represented a tarot card
          and kabbalah branch and an internal psychological reality that the protagonist
          journeyed through. Each volume just builds and builds and the colours and
          patterns progressively get more intricate and lush until the multicoloured
          crescendo in the end.  I hope that''s more of a spur to those who haven''t
          read, rather than spoiler. '

    body: 'One thing I recall in that disinfo lecture was the topic of GM going to
      Kathmandu for the purpose of making contact with an inter-dimensional entity
      and having that experience, only because I too have experienced the vision/hallucination
      of a light(ship?)display that morphed itself into varying geometric shapes in
      front of me, before traversing down the river about 5km into the distance in
      a manner of 6 or 7 seconds on the ganges in Varanasi. That or the man next to
      me had laced datura in the hashish he had given me a toke of.



      Whenever GMeme is mentioned i automatically enter into the state of mind that
      wants to explore the mystery of this weird fucking occurrence or go on a psychogeographical
      vagabond aware-wander around Northern India. I haven''t read anything of his,
      but it doesn''t really seem that important; that lecture is enough of a stimulus
      or even just to imagine him, he''s your regulation trickster archetype


      Oh actually Pop Magic is a great little primer. I did try two volumes of the
      Invisibles but felt the dialogue did not feel natural or have any flow and felt
      that feeling when an author is trying to teach you various topics through the
      characters conversations and it just comes off preachy and unnatural.'

  body: I loved The Invisibles.  Changed my life in fact.  Tried listening to him
    on youtube.  He's smart and has some weird ideas (paraphrasing, "all of reality
    is some kind of giant, fractalline amoeba octopus made of hyperdimensional, rotating
    ideas") --smacks of Terrence.  But I find he's hard to listen to because of the
    accent.  I like him.  I've learned a lot from him about magic and sigils and symbols.  I'm
    a type of person who cared not the least in these things 3 yrs ago.

  body: 'I don''t know of the person, but I have concerns with superheroes and other
    modern mythological entities, which have in many respects replaced the role of
    gods, demons, and angels. We respond to fiction and narrative as if it were real,

    to inform and show possibility, or it can be used to consume and overwrite one''s
    own narrative and those of living beings around them parasitically.

    Is that the case? To me it sounds like just another product to hide the fear rather
    than face it. Making something appear to disappear without actually doing it.
    Out of sight, out of mind, at least until the ramifications come home to roost.


    I believe the only true liberation from fear comes from addressing those fears
    directly and in the nude, to expose yourself to them rather than obfuscating them.
    As a society, we need to be scared shitless to our very foundations to such an
    extent that no pill or magic trick can alleviate or mask the existential terror
    - only directly facing it head-on.'

selftext: 'He''s a comic book writer and self-proclaimed sorcerer who believes superheroes
  can save us from tyranny and other evils. He''s written a number of well-known comic
  books, many of which were "hypersigils," feedback loops of symbols and magic designed
  to change both the creator and the world at large.


  He wrote Batman for several years, telling a story through which the Caped Crusader
  killed Darkseid (DC''s god of darkness, hatred, and submission to tyranny) with
  the Platonic form of Bullet, then was sent back in time, ultimately planting the
  seeds of a cult worshiping him throughout history and being "reborn" as the new
  God of the night, so that people wouldn''t have to be afraid of the dark anymore.


  In a recent series, Multiversity, a multiversal Justice League fought an enemy called
  The Gentry which wanted to enter every universe including our own (earth prime,
  from which all other universes stem).


  He''s now the chief editor of Heavy Metal Magazine, and appears on the cover flipping
  the bird to the reader.


  I personally admire his work, am fascinated by his story telling, and love the sense
  of possibility that he manages to create, while carefully using the tools of the
  comics themselves (the space around the edge of the page is The Bleed, the area
  between universes) to resist his comics being made into movies.
